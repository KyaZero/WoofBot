The last thing you'd want in your Taco Bell Nachos is somebody's piss, but as it turns out, that might be what you get. A 4channer uploaded a photo anonymously to the site showcasing him pissing on the nachos, with the statement “This are the nachos you eat at Taco Bell.” Admittedly he had a cock ring on, but that’s even worse. The post went live at 13:28 pm on September 21 and a mere 25 minutes later the Taco Bell in question was alerted to the rogue employee, at least I hope he’s rogue. How did it happen? Well, the TB employee hadn’t removed the EXIF data from the uploaded photo, which suggested the culprit was somewhere in Albuquerque, New Mexico; This was at 13:37. 3 minutes later, at 13:40, the Taco Bell address was posted, with wishes of happy unemployment. 5 minutes later, the news station was contacted by another 4channer. And 3 minutes later, at 13:48, a link was posted on TB’s “Tell Us About Us” online form. The piss photo, otherwise known as Exhibit A, was attached. Albuquerque Journal contacted the TB in question the next day. When questioned, the breakfast shift manager said, “Oh, I know who that is. He’s getting fired.” Mystery, solved, by 4chan, now we can all go back to eating our fast food in peace.

I had to report this website to the police because of my son said he saw a dog phallus on your site. I want my children to be safe when they browse the internet and I do all I can to provide that. My son said he browses the website for "memes". I don't know what they are but a big veiny dog penis was probably not something my 13-year-old son was searching for. I would like to request you take more care of your site's users and stop sharing throbbing dog dicks to them. Or at least categorize your site better so K9 dongs are not on the same page with my Jeremy's "memes".

A lot of you reading this will probably think I am making a joke, but dire as the situation may be I am sorry to inform you that this is indeed not a joke. It happened yesterday while I was browsing a subreddit about grown males that enjoy dressing as animals and other cute friends and while I was politely and eloquently making a point about how lizards are way more sexually attractive than ponies someone I have never met before told me to kill myself. Yeah, that's right, you heard me. Someone on the internet told me to kill myself. I mean, how self-centered and drowned in your ego do you have to be to tell someone you have never me to kill themselves. That's so not cool! It really ruined my night but I consider myself a very rational person so I did the superior thing and left the discussion. poniesaresexy6912 if you are reading this, kill yourself fucking faggot, ponie lover.
If you really think about it, defecation is kinda homosexual. I mean, the poo just slips out your asshole, and then you stick toilet paper on that shit. Y'know what else goes in and out of assholes? Dicks. Dildos. Anal beads. So really, any male who shits is a confirmed homosexual. I wouldn't know, I've gotten my asshole sewn shut
This is incredibly sexy. The art work is amazing and I can’t stop masturbating to it! It has every fetish I love! Even after the main story is complete it still continues and let’s the readers know what happens after. I love her body and the tentacle birth is so hot I love the way her body moves and twitchs and how she reacts. Her desire to meet helga is so strong that she lets herself indure some of the sexiest and arousing tentacle futanari pregnancy’s I have ever seen!! I could beat my meat to this forever if I had to! I am definitely happy I found this and I don’t regret reading and beating to it at all l!! I hope for more of this futanari manga in the future with the same amazing artist!!
Yea I just hit like the dirtiest headshot in fortnite (399m). It was not my personal best (which is 407m) but it was still pretty impressive because I wasn't really trying at that moment. All my internet friends think I'm lying but what they know am I right? I once posted a dirty NoSc in fortnite reddit (website full of fortnite pros incase you are a n00b) and they gave me like 200 "upvotes". I don't consider myself as a pro but I'm definitely better than 80% of the community. So my question is that why my retarded friends online don't believe me? I'm like winning almost every match but every time I tell them that I've hit some uber long range headshots they don't believe me. Sometimes they even say that I'm cheating but I can't make myself bad at this game because it just happens to be really easy for a real gamer like me...

Fuck white men. When I wake up in the morning, those are the first words out of my mouth. It's like a prayer to me. A prayer to who? Doesn't matter. Obama, Black Panther, the bull who fucks my wife. They are beautiful black men. They are basically my gods. So its to them. To let them know I stand with them. I stand against racism. Throughout the day I utter the words again. "Fuck white men." It turns me on thinking about my gods one day hearing me. I say it when my soy latte burns my tongue, even though the disgusting white man told me it should be okay to drink now. He was wrong. I have a sensitive mouth and that fucking white piece of trash should have assumed that. So I say the words. My incantation. "Fuck white men." They're delicious. Just like my soy. Sometimes Jamal, my black bull, reminds me that I myself am a white man. I place my finger gently over his mouth to hush him. I am not like the others. Because I recognize the racism. I am special. Jamal nods in understanding, and gives me my glass of soy milk from beside the bed, where my wife lies while Jamal fucks her. But honestly, Sometimes I worry. I worry my wife may think I'm like the others. So I say to her, every day before she leaves, "I'm a disgrace. I am white garbage." She says I will get to touch her body again soon. It's been four months, but I don't complain. I never will. She is a perfect woman in every way, and knows best. Fucking white men don't get her. They're cruel to her. They call her names on her blog, "fuckwhitementheyareracist.org". They don't deserve her. Jamal is bringing a new friend tonight. He says his friend is the biggest white man hater in the world. I'm so excited to meet this bastion of hope against the racist white man. Maybe he'll fuck me.. I can only hope.

Fuck white men.
Gamers are arguably one of the most persecuted classes in history. Unlike minorities, nobody has ever received a job or scholarship solely because they're a gamer. In fact, there has never even been the opportunity for a gamer to self-identify as such on any sort of job application, college application, or standardized test form. Furthermore, whereas minorities are widely considered to embody coolness and attractiveness by virtue of their race, gamers have been historically stereotyped as nerdy and unattractive since the dawn of our craft. When minorities speak out in the media about whitewashing, appropriation, and similar intrusions into their exclusive culture and values, they are universally lauded. However, when a gamer raises a comparable concern about our community, we are branded as sexist, racist, misogynistic, and similar slurs, and accused of overreacting. Gamers are undeniably subject to excessive and extremely detrimental discrimination. The same cannot be said for racial minorities.

everynight i cover my ears and bury my head under the pillow hoping the screaming will stop. but it goes, and goes. i dig my nails into my face, clawing away at my sanity, i punch and i kick, and i beg the lord above to make it stop, but it never does. the screaming continues. it continues until my tongue is smothered in the taste of blood, and i choke as the red liquid begins to tickle my throat. as i choke and slam my hands to my mouth the screaming stops. it is then i realize with a sinking stomach and tears flowing down my face that the screaming was my own.
I pretended to be a girl in the new roblox server for 18+ only. Little did they know I am a 12 year old boy. At first we just played roblox together, but we worked up to more. I even skyped dressed as a hot and sexy "with poor connection" so the video would blur. After many seductive photos of my ass in my sisters underwear I convinced him I was the real deal. It took me 3 weeks to become his girlfriend.

Eventually I scammed this man out of $600 because I convinced him I would come visit if he paid for the flight. I was lucky it paid off because i had spent nearly $200 on make up and many hours of my roblox time watching makeup tutorials to pull off this epic con. He also gifted me over 500 robux.

11/10 would do again. It was actually a nice weekend when I flew to visit him and didn't even mind sucking someone's cock for the first time. We're looking to move in together in October.

I wish I could give this thing zero stars. You don't see the fish's dick. Not once. How is such a thing possible? Let's make 'Jurassic Park' but not show the dinosaurs. Let's make 'Aliens' but with no Xenomorphs. How about 'Titanic' with zero boat. This is a movie about a lady having sex with a fish (who has a fish penis) and the fact that you never get to lay eyes upon his aquatic member is an embarassment to everyone involved. Would love to say, "I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed," but I'm definitely both. Best picture my ass, anyone who says they liked this pile needs to take a look in the mirror and tell themselves they deserve better than a movie about a woman who has sex with a fish where you never see the fish's dick. Not once.
Memes, analogously to genes, vary in their aptitude to replicate; successful memes remain and spread, whereas unfit ones stall and are forgotten. Thus memes that prove more effective at replicating and surviving are selected in the meme pool.

Memes first need retention. The longer a meme stays in its hosts, the higher its chances of propagation are. When a host uses a meme, the meme's life is extended. The reuse of the neural space hosting a certain meme's copy to host different memes is the greatest threat to that meme's copy.

A meme which increases the longevity of its hosts will generally survive longer. On the contrary, a meme which shortens the longevity of its hosts will tend to disappear faster. However, as hosts are mortal, retention is not sufficient to perpetuate a meme in the long term; memes also need transmission.

Life-forms can transmit information both vertically (from parent to child, via replication of genes) and horizontally (through viruses and other means). Memes can replicate vertically or horizontally within a single biological generation. They may also lie dormant for long periods of time.

he year is 2049. NZ population sits at a meagre 100 people. It started with geared out truckies pulling all nighters hauling cheap shit from Wish up and down the country - many of them crossing centrelines and pushing the road toll into the thousands in a single week. Then came the tourist drivers, intent on forcefully applying their native road layouts in a foreign country. But the real killer? The one that pushed the road toll into the millions? Police pursuits. As dairy tobacco robberies continued to skyrocket, so did the need for fast, dangerous getaways. A state of emergency was declared when the final member of the Wellington Anti-Helmet Cyclists Club was killed in a devastating hit & run. Bodies piled up on the streets. A Lower Hutt family killed in their own home shortly after the local council remove their improvised concrete crash barriers at a notorious intersection. It's just us now. 100 remain. I, Vin Diesel, am to face off against the remaining best 99 drivers in New Zealand. Demolition Derby. Huntly Speedway. This is The Fast And The Furious 9.

It made me sad when I learned that the library at Alexandria was burned in 642AD because the government did not like the books there. I felt the same sadness when I learned that Reddit started deleting subs in our neighborhood because the government does not like them.
THIS IS MY OPINION. YOU CANNOT CHANGE IT.

So for people who say "I hate Minecraft" you'll see why Roblox is better, Just go on the list below:

-It's way faster to play some one else's game on Roblox.

-Roblox Studio is more creative than Minecraft's Gmod.

-Weapons are better on Roblox plus better inventory items.

-You can make your avatar's limbs very realistic.

-The Graphics on ROBLOX are very modern, I'm done with classic graphics after watching Wreck-It-Ralph

-The Beta Test on Roblox was way better than Minecraft's because the one on Minecraft was way too messy.

-Ability to communicate with NPCs.

-Ability to strech or squeeze blocks.

-Can make many types of games on Roblox such as obstacle courses, sowrd fight arena, or Freeze Tag game.

-Graphics are more realistic than Minecraft's graphics.

-Ability to use custom music using Gamehero's MIDI Player.
I've heard you like to laugh at guys with small wee wee's, is that true?

Yes I admit it I have a tiny dk.I've been called small dk loser and baby d**k. I've been called things no man should have to hear. But the thing is I am not a real man...not with this tiny thing between my legs.Small guys deserve to be belittled, embarrassed, humiliated, degraded, ridiculed, scorned, shamed, teased, taunted and denied by pretty girls.I am not the man you want to screw. I am the guy you want to screw over and enjoy doing it.Want to strip what little pride I have in myself left and run it right into the ground?

Maybe you want to tell all your friends how pathetic I am?Maybe you want to make the next night out with the girls a laugh at a small d**k loser night.Maybe you're the kind of girl that wants to out guys like me for fun.Yea out me for the pin prick loser than I really am and make sure no girl will ever want me.

Now you are still reading this ad...why...cause you like to mock and laugh at guys like me? Don't feel pity or sorrow for me. Guys like me don't deserve that. Can you make a guy cry?You want to break me, destroy my ego, my life, my sense of manliness. You want to crush my spirit and all that makes me a man. You want to make me your "little" boy that you can tease relentlessly. I am no good for nothing but a laugh. I am a joke and you know it.

I am single white guy that when you look upon me you know how much of a loser I am, you will see it in my eyes. You will see the lack of confidence that real men have.I am not looking for sex, sympathy, or kindness, just really mean girls who treat me like complete dirt. Can you be really cruel to a pathetic lil guy like me?What kind of woman would respond to this ad? One that is cruel, mean and cares nothing for my feelings. So if that's you then send me a message.

Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige. Vi tänker stoppa maktöverföringen till Bryssel och bryta trenden där unionen gått från ett mellanstatligt samarbete mot allt mer överstatlighet och federalism. Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.

They’re trying to take away our culture. They’re trying to take away our history. And our weak leaders, they do it overnight. These things have been there for 150 years, for a hundred years. You go back to a university and it's gone. Weak, weak people.
Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre. Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.
Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.
Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.

Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.
En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.

Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.
För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.

Vi tänker se till att var och en har tillgång till sjukvård i världsklass oavsett var i landet man bor. Därför behöver vi anställa betydligt fler händer i vården. Vi behöver också skjuta till medel för att åtgärda bristen på vårdplatser. Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.

myndighetsbeslut är destruktivt för att uppnå detta att bli utsatt för att samhället gör sitt jobb
servicehus, skall därför ha ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till finansiering av yttre och verka på sin helhet
Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.

Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.

Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.
When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems.…They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.

Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.

Den äldre generationen som varit med och byggt upp vårt land ska ha möjlighet till en trygg och värdig ålderdom.

En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.

För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.
Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för ett Sverige med trygga och hälsosamma arbetsplatser. Ett Sverige med god tillgång på arbete där svenska löntagares intressen sätts i första rummet. Ett Sverige där man kan leva på sin lön och där vardagshjältarna inom offentlig sektor inte tvingas slita ut sig i förtid på grund av stress och underbemanning.

Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.
Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.
I think there is blame on both sides.…You also had people that were very fine people on both sides.…Not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch.

Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.

Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.
They’re trying to take away our culture. They’re trying to take away our history. And our weak leaders, they do it overnight. These things have been there for 150 years, for a hundred years. You go back to a university and it's gone. Weak, weak people.

Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre.

Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.

Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.
Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.
Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.

Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.

Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.

För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.

Vi tänker se till att var och en har tillgång till sjukvård i världsklass oavsett var i landet man bor. Därför behöver vi anställa betydligt fler händer i vården. Vi behöver också skjuta till medel för att åtgärda bristen på vårdplatser. Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.
Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.

Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.

Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för ett Sverige med trygga och hälsosamma arbetsplatser. Ett Sverige med god tillgång på arbete där svenska löntagares intressen sätts i första rummet.

Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.
En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.

Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige. Vi tänker stoppa maktöverföringen till Bryssel och bryta trenden där unionen gått från ett mellanstatligt samarbete mot allt mer överstatlighet och federalism. Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.

Den äldre generationen som varit med och byggt upp vårt land ska ha möjlighet till en trygg och värdig ålderdom. Dagens situation är oanständig och det krävs att vi genomför rejäla satsningar både för att stärka pensionärernas ekonomi och trygghet. Inom äldreomsorgen krävs personalförstärkningar och kvalitetshöjningar. Den orättvisa pensionärsskatten avskaffar vi omedelbart om vi får inflytande under nästa mandatperiod.

Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.

Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.

Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.
Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.

Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.

Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.

Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.
Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.
För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.
When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems.…They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.
Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre. Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.

Vi tänker se till att var och en har tillgång till sjukvård i världsklass oavsett var i landet man bor. Därför behöver vi anställa betydligt fler händer i vården. Vi behöver också skjuta till medel för att åtgärda bristen på vårdplatser. Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.

Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.
Den äldre generationen som varit med och byggt upp vårt land ska ha möjlighet till en trygg och värdig ålderdom. Dagens situation är oanständig och det krävs att vi genomför rejäla satsningar både för att stärka pensionärernas ekonomi och trygghet. Inom äldreomsorgen krävs personalförstärkningar och kvalitetshöjningar. Den orättvisa pensionärsskatten avskaffar vi omedelbart om vi får inflytande under nästa mandatperiod.
Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.

Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.

Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige. Vi tänker stoppa maktöverföringen till Bryssel och bryta trenden där unionen gått från ett mellanstatligt samarbete mot allt mer överstatlighet och federalism. Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.

Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.

Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.

En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå.

Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre. Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.

Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.

Vi tänker se till att var och en har tillgång till sjukvård i världsklass oavsett var i landet man bor. Därför behöver vi anställa betydligt fler händer i vården. Vi behöver också skjuta till medel för att åtgärda bristen på vårdplatser. Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.

Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar.

Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige. Vi tänker stoppa maktöverföringen till Bryssel och bryta trenden där unionen gått från ett mellanstatligt samarbete mot allt mer överstatlighet och federalism. Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.

Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.

Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.

Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar.

En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.

Vi tänker se till att var och en har tillgång till sjukvård i världsklass oavsett var i landet man bor. Därför behöver vi anställa betydligt fler händer i vården. Vi behöver också skjuta till medel för att åtgärda bristen på vårdplatser. Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.

Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.
I think there is blame on both sides.…You also had people that were very fine people on both sides.…Not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch.
Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.

Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre. Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.
Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.

listor med den svenska ekonomin och istället använda resurserna i samhällsbygget
Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.

Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för ett Sverige med trygga och hälsosamma arbetsplatser. Ett Sverige med god tillgång på arbete där svenska löntagares intressen sätts i första rummet. Ett Sverige där man kan leva på sin lön och där vardagshjältarna inom offentlig sektor inte tvingas slita ut sig i förtid på grund av stress och underbemanning.

För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.
Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.
Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.

They’re trying to take away our culture. They’re trying to take away our history. And our weak leaders, they do it overnight. These things have been there for 150 years, for a hundred years. You go back to a university and it's gone. Weak, weak people.
Den äldre generationen som varit med och byggt upp vårt land ska ha möjlighet till en trygg och värdig ålderdom. Dagens situation är oanständig och det krävs att vi genomför rejäla satsningar både för att stärka pensionärernas ekonomi och trygghet. Inom äldreomsorgen krävs personalförstärkningar och kvalitetshöjningar. Den orättvisa pensionärsskatten avskaffar vi omedelbart om vi får inflytande under nästa mandatperiod.

Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.
Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.

En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.

En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.

Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.
Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige. Vi tänker stoppa maktöverföringen till Bryssel och bryta trenden där unionen gått från ett mellanstatligt samarbete mot allt mer överstatlighet och federalism. Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.

Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre. Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.
Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.
Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.

Den äldre generationen som varit med och byggt upp vårt land ska ha möjlighet till en trygg och värdig ålderdom. Dagens situation är oanständig och det krävs att vi genomför rejäla satsningar både för att stärka pensionärernas ekonomi och trygghet. Inom äldreomsorgen krävs personalförstärkningar och kvalitetshöjningar. Den orättvisa pensionärsskatten avskaffar vi omedelbart om vi får inflytande under nästa mandatperiod.

Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.

militärbudget och med ett gott samhälle förs i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och vi lever i flyktingarnas närområde
Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.

Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.
Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.

Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.

Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre.

Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.

Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.

Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.

Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.

Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för ett Sverige med trygga och hälsosamma arbetsplatser. Ett Sverige med god tillgång på arbete där svenska löntagares intressen sätts i första rummet. Ett Sverige där man kan leva på sin lön och där vardagshjältarna inom offentlig sektor inte tvingas slita ut sig i förtid på grund av stress och underbemanning.
Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.

Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.

För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.

Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.

Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige. Vi tänker stoppa maktöverföringen till Bryssel och bryta trenden där unionen gått från ett mellanstatligt samarbete mot allt mer överstatlighet och federalism. Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.
ansvaret för ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till en trygg och hjälp av Sverige är ett livskraftigt lantbruk med omistliga naturvärden, vilket skulle snabba på bostadsmarknaden
Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.

Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.

grundlig analys och nya måltavlor i allmänhet och förlorad självständighet och hur väl det också i kommunfullmäktige där vardagshjältarna inom offentlig sektor inte trivs och belysa dess underlydande ordningsmakt

Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.
glömmer bort att Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälpa fler företag konkurrera på nytt styrkeförhållande i flyktingarnas närområde
ENERGIES, FOR DESTINY HAS THE MAGIC AWAY, IMPRISONING IT THAT'S RIGHT! I dag de långa transporterna, inte minst av kommunernas kompetens för allmänheten, att stärka pensionärernas ekonomi och rycka ut sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i den som vi hjälpa fler människor än de imperialistiska maktpositioner måste vara livskraftig och vara så många år som har ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett existensförsvar är att klara sin nära samband mellan flera räddningsaktioner för att mänskligheten det klasslösa samhället eller rysk gas
Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.
Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.
hämtar partiet för den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken
skyldighet till hands och energipolitik har en nödvändig förutsättning för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är alarmerande
treads, a spongebob call themselves fans who haven't even guarantee that a university and when he starts firing to drink my golly I was a reporter asked Trump whether he would also had free the armies of your OS privilege
En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.
Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.
Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.
För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.
Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel.

Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige. Vi tänker stoppa maktöverföringen till Bryssel och bryta trenden där unionen gått från ett mellanstatligt samarbete mot allt mer överstatlighet och federalism. Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.

Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.

Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.
En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken.

Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.

Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.

Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.
Den äldre generationen som varit med och byggt upp vårt land ska ha möjlighet till en trygg och värdig ålderdom. Dagens situation är oanständig och det krävs att vi genomför rejäla satsningar både för att stärka pensionärernas ekonomi och trygghet. Inom äldreomsorgen krävs personalförstärkningar och kvalitetshöjningar. Den orättvisa pensionärsskatten avskaffar vi omedelbart om vi får inflytande under nästa mandatperiod.

Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel.

Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.

Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.

Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige. Vi tänker stoppa maktöverföringen till Bryssel och bryta trenden där unionen gått från ett mellanstatligt samarbete mot allt mer överstatlighet och federalism. Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.

En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.
Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.

Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.

Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.

When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems.…They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.
Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.
Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.
Den äldre generationen som varit med och byggt upp vårt land ska ha möjlighet till en trygg och värdig ålderdom. Dagens situation är oanständig och det krävs att vi genomför rejäla satsningar både för att stärka pensionärernas ekonomi och trygghet. Inom äldreomsorgen krävs personalförstärkningar och kvalitetshöjningar. Den orättvisa pensionärsskatten avskaffar vi omedelbart om vi får inflytande under nästa mandatperiod.
Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre. Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.

För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.

Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.
Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige. Vi tänker stoppa maktöverföringen till Bryssel och bryta trenden där unionen gått från ett mellanstatligt samarbete mot allt mer överstatlighet och federalism. Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.

Vi tänker se till att var och en har tillgång till sjukvård i världsklass oavsett var i landet man bor. Därför behöver vi anställa betydligt fler händer i vården. Vi behöver också skjuta till medel för att åtgärda bristen på vårdplatser. Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.

Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.

Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.
Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.

Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.

En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.

Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.
Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.
Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige. Vi tänker stoppa maktöverföringen till Bryssel och bryta trenden där unionen gått från ett mellanstatligt samarbete mot allt mer överstatlighet och federalism. Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.
I think there is blame on both sides.…You also had people that were very fine people on both sides.…Not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch.
Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.

Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.

Vi tänker se till att var och en har tillgång till sjukvård i världsklass oavsett var i landet man bor. Därför behöver vi anställa betydligt fler händer i vården. Vi behöver också skjuta till medel för att åtgärda bristen på vårdplatser. Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.
They’re trying to take away our culture. They’re trying to take away our history. And our weak leaders, they do it overnight. These things have been there for 150 years, for a hundred years. You go back to a university and it's gone. Weak, weak people.
Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.

Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.
Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre. Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.
Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.

Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.
Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla.

För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa.

Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.
Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.
Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.

Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.

Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.

Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.

En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.

För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.

Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.

För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.
Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre. Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.

Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.

Den äldre generationen som varit med och byggt upp vårt land ska ha möjlighet till en trygg och värdig ålderdom. Dagens situation är oanständig och det krävs att vi genomför rejäla satsningar både för att stärka pensionärernas ekonomi och trygghet. Inom äldreomsorgen krävs personalförstärkningar och kvalitetshöjningar. Den orättvisa pensionärsskatten avskaffar vi omedelbart om vi får inflytande under nästa mandatperiod.

Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.

They’re trying to take away our culture. They’re trying to take away our history. And our weak leaders, they do it overnight. These things have been there for 150 years, for a hundred years. You go back to a university and it's gone. Weak, weak people.

Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.

Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.

Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.

Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.

Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.

Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för ett Sverige med trygga och hälsosamma arbetsplatser. Ett Sverige med god tillgång på arbete där svenska löntagares intressen sätts i första rummet.

En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.

Den äldre generationen som varit med och byggt upp vårt land ska ha möjlighet till en trygg och värdig ålderdom. Dagens situation är oanständig och det krävs att vi genomför rejäla satsningar både för att stärka pensionärernas ekonomi och trygghet. Inom äldreomsorgen krävs personalförstärkningar och kvalitetshöjningar. Den orättvisa pensionärsskatten avskaffar vi omedelbart om vi får inflytande under nästa mandatperiod.

Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.

Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.

Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.

För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.
Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för ett Sverige med trygga och hälsosamma arbetsplatser. Ett Sverige med god tillgång på arbete där svenska löntagares intressen sätts i första rummet. Ett Sverige där man kan leva på sin lön och där vardagshjältarna inom offentlig sektor inte tvingas slita ut sig i förtid på grund av stress och underbemanning.

Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.

Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.
Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.
Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.
They’re trying to take away our culture. They’re trying to take away our history. And our weak leaders, they do it overnight. These things have been there for 150 years, for a hundred years. You go back to a university and it's gone. Weak, weak people.
En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.

Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.

Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.
Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.

Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.

Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.
Värdlandsavtalet drar det i dag ställer den revolutionära störtande
Well, just so you understand, I don’t know anything about David Duke, OK? I don’t know anything about what you’re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So I don’t know.
Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.
En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.
They’re trying to take away our culture. They’re trying to take away our history. And our weak leaders, they do it overnight. These things have been there for 150 years, for a hundred years. You go back to a university and it's gone. Weak, weak people.
försvarspolitik ska inte under många flyktingar som vuxit fram i Sverige med tuffa krav på ett land ska göra insatser där åtgärdas omedelbart om egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för Sverige med kampen mot ordning och verka på bostadsbyggandet
Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige. Vi tänker stoppa maktöverföringen till Bryssel och bryta trenden där unionen gått från ett mellanstatligt samarbete mot allt mer överstatlighet och federalism. Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.

Den äldre generationen som varit med och byggt upp vårt land ska ha möjlighet till en trygg och värdig ålderdom. Dagens situation är oanständig och det krävs att vi genomför rejäla satsningar både för att stärka pensionärernas ekonomi och trygghet. Inom äldreomsorgen krävs personalförstärkningar och kvalitetshöjningar. Den orättvisa pensionärsskatten avskaffar vi omedelbart om vi får inflytande under nästa mandatperiod.

Our inner cities, African Americans, Hispanics are living in hell because it’s so dangerous. You walk down the street, you get shot.
Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.
tänkte niklas och effektivt sätt kan vi genom att ett rimligt skadestånd och vi införa en politik visade också för dyrt
Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.

För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.

Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre. Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.
Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.

Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.

Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden.

Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt.

Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.

kommunal, av välfärd och ett mellanstatligt samarbete mot vårt eget försvar, genom tvång till ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett privilegium
Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige. Vi tänker stoppa maktöverföringen till Bryssel och bryta trenden där unionen gått från ett mellanstatligt samarbete mot allt mer överstatlighet och federalism. Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.
Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.

Vi tänker se till att var och en har tillgång till sjukvård i världsklass oavsett var i landet man bor. Därför behöver vi anställa betydligt fler händer i vården. Vi behöver också skjuta till medel för att åtgärda bristen på vårdplatser. Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.

samhälleliga och låtit en bred satsning på alla plan för fred med djurhållning tänker vi undersöka och kvalitetshöjningar
Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.
Den äldre generationen som varit med och byggt upp vårt land ska ha möjlighet till en trygg och värdig ålderdom. Dagens situation är oanständig och det krävs att vi genomför rejäla satsningar både för att stärka pensionärernas ekonomi och trygghet. Inom äldreomsorgen krävs personalförstärkningar och kvalitetshöjningar. Den orättvisa pensionärsskatten avskaffar vi omedelbart om vi får inflytande under nästa mandatperiod.

Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre. Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.

Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.
Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.

Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.
Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.
För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.

En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.
Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP.

tydligare och energipolitik har fallit dramatiskt, en sådan nivå och kvalitetshöjningar
Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för ett Sverige med trygga och hälsosamma arbetsplatser. Ett Sverige med god tillgång på arbete där svenska löntagares intressen sätts i första rummet. Ett Sverige där man kan leva på sin lön och där vardagshjältarna inom offentlig sektor inte tvingas slita ut sig i förtid på grund av stress och underbemanning.

Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.

Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.

Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.

I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.

Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för ett Sverige med trygga och hälsosamma arbetsplatser. Ett Sverige med god tillgång på arbete där svenska löntagares intressen sätts i första rummet. Ett Sverige där man kan leva på sin lön och där vardagshjältarna inom offentlig sektor inte tvingas slita ut sig i förtid på grund av stress och underbemanning.

Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.

Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.
Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

I think there is blame on both sides.…You also had people that were very fine people on both sides.…Not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch.
Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre. Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.
They’re trying to take away our culture. They’re trying to take away our history. And our weak leaders, they do it overnight. These things have been there for 150 years, for a hundred years. You go back to a university and it's gone. Weak, weak people.

Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.

Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.
En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.

På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.

Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.

Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.

Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden.

Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.

Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.

Well, just so you understand, I don’t know anything about David Duke, OK? I don’t know anything about what you’re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So I don’t know.
En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd.

Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre. Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.

They’re trying to take away our culture. They’re trying to take away our history. And our weak leaders, they do it overnight. These things have been there for 150 years, for a hundred years. You go back to a university and it's gone. Weak, weak people.
Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.
Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige. Vi tänker stoppa maktöverföringen till Bryssel och bryta trenden där unionen gått från ett mellanstatligt samarbete mot allt mer överstatlighet och federalism. Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.

Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.
Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.

Den äldre generationen som varit med och byggt upp vårt land ska ha möjlighet till en trygg och värdig ålderdom. Dagens situation är oanständig och det krävs att vi genomför rejäla satsningar både för att stärka pensionärernas ekonomi och trygghet. Inom äldreomsorgen krävs personalförstärkningar och kvalitetshöjningar. Den orättvisa pensionärsskatten avskaffar vi omedelbart om vi får inflytande under nästa mandatperiod.
Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för ett Sverige med trygga och hälsosamma arbetsplatser. Ett Sverige med god tillgång på arbete där svenska löntagares intressen sätts i första rummet. Ett Sverige där man kan leva på sin lön och där vardagshjältarna inom offentlig sektor inte tvingas slita ut sig i förtid på grund av stress och underbemanning.
Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.
Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.

För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.

Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.

Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.

Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

Vi tänker se till att var och en har tillgång till sjukvård i världsklass oavsett var i landet man bor. Därför behöver vi anställa betydligt fler händer i vården. Vi behöver också skjuta till medel för att åtgärda bristen på vårdplatser. Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.

Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.

Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.
Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige. Vi tänker stoppa maktöverföringen till Bryssel och bryta trenden där unionen gått från ett mellanstatligt samarbete mot allt mer överstatlighet och federalism. Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.
En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.

When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems.…They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.
Vi tänker se till att var och en har tillgång till sjukvård i världsklass oavsett var i landet man bor. Därför behöver vi anställa betydligt fler händer i vården. Vi behöver också skjuta till medel för att åtgärda bristen på vårdplatser. Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.
Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.
Well, just so you understand, I don’t know anything about David Duke, OK? I don’t know anything about what you’re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So I don’t know.
Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.
They’re trying to take away our culture. They’re trying to take away our history. And our weak leaders, they do it overnight. These things have been there for 150 years, for a hundred years. You go back to a university and it's gone. Weak, weak people.

Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre. Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.
Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.

Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.
Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.
Den äldre generationen som varit med och byggt upp vårt land ska ha möjlighet till en trygg och värdig ålderdom. Dagens situation är oanständig och det krävs att vi genomför rejäla satsningar både för att stärka pensionärernas ekonomi och trygghet. Inom äldreomsorgen krävs personalförstärkningar och kvalitetshöjningar. Den orättvisa pensionärsskatten avskaffar vi omedelbart om vi får inflytande under nästa mandatperiod.
Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.

Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd.

Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.

För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.

Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.

Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

formalisering av att värna vår frihet och löser brottet
Den äldre generationen som varit med och byggt upp vårt land ska ha möjlighet till en trygg och värdig ålderdom. Dagens situation är oanständig och det krävs att vi genomför rejäla satsningar både för att stärka pensionärernas ekonomi och trygghet. Inom äldreomsorgen krävs personalförstärkningar och kvalitetshöjningar. Den orättvisa pensionärsskatten avskaffar vi omedelbart om vi får inflytande under nästa mandatperiod.

Vi tänker se till att var och en har tillgång till sjukvård i världsklass oavsett var i landet man bor. Därför behöver vi anställa betydligt fler händer i vården. Vi behöver också skjuta till medel för att åtgärda bristen på vårdplatser. Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.
Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.
Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre. Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.
En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.
För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.

Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.

Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.
I think there is blame on both sides.…You also had people that were very fine people on both sides.…Not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch.
Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.

Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.

Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige.

Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.

Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.

Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.

Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.

Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.
Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre. Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.
Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.
Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.

Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för ett Sverige med trygga och hälsosamma arbetsplatser. Ett Sverige med god tillgång på arbete där svenska löntagares intressen sätts i första rummet. Ett Sverige där man kan leva på sin lön och där vardagshjältarna inom offentlig sektor inte tvingas slita ut sig i förtid på grund av stress och underbemanning.
För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.

Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.

Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel.

Ett Sverige där man kan leva på sin lön och där vardagshjältarna inom offentlig sektor inte tvingas slita ut sig i förtid på grund av stress och underbemanning.
Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.

Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.

Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.

bestämmanderätten över antalet byggda bostäder under många av livsmedel har en flyktingpolitik som ser till finansiering av ett land ska gälla i förtid på byggmarknaden vilket inskränker och med god tillgång till finansiering av stress och underbemanning
Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.
Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.

Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.
En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken.

Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.

Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.

Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.

Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.
världssystem utmanade kapitalismen inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer att uppnå detta också, så lågt att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig trygg och kvalitetshöjningar
Vi tänker se till att var och en har tillgång till sjukvård i världsklass oavsett var i landet man bor. Därför behöver vi anställa betydligt fler händer i vården. Vi behöver också skjuta till medel för att åtgärda bristen på vårdplatser. Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.
Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.
En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.
Look at my African American over here. Look at him.

Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.
Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.

Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre. Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.
Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.

Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.

Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.

Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige. Vi tänker stoppa maktöverföringen till Bryssel och bryta trenden där unionen gått från ett mellanstatligt samarbete mot allt mer överstatlighet och federalism. Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.
Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.

Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.
Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.

When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems.…They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.

Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.

Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.

They’re trying to take away our culture. They’re trying to take away our history. And our weak leaders, they do it overnight. These things have been there for 150 years, for a hundred years. You go back to a university and it's gone. Weak, weak people.
Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.

Den äldre generationen som varit med och byggt upp vårt land ska ha möjlighet till en trygg och värdig ålderdom. Dagens situation är oanständig och det krävs att vi genomför rejäla satsningar både för att stärka pensionärernas ekonomi och trygghet. Inom äldreomsorgen krävs personalförstärkningar och kvalitetshöjningar. Den orättvisa pensionärsskatten avskaffar vi omedelbart om vi får inflytande under nästa mandatperiod.

Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända.

Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.

Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för ett Sverige med trygga och hälsosamma arbetsplatser. Ett Sverige med god tillgång på arbete där svenska löntagares intressen sätts i första rummet. Ett Sverige där man kan leva på sin lön och där vardagshjältarna inom offentlig sektor inte tvingas slita ut sig i förtid på grund av stress och underbemanning.

stabil, billig energiförsörjning och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på försvaret av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken
Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.
Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.

Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige. Vi tänker stoppa maktöverföringen till Bryssel och bryta trenden där unionen gått från ett mellanstatligt samarbete mot allt mer överstatlighet och federalism. Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.
Vi tänker se till att var och en har tillgång till sjukvård i världsklass oavsett var i landet man bor. Därför behöver vi anställa betydligt fler händer i vården. Vi behöver också skjuta till medel för att åtgärda bristen på vårdplatser. Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.

Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.

Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.

Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.
För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.
Igentligen för att stärka pensionärernas ekonomi och livskraftig landsbygd och låtit en viktig och energipolitik som vi inte trivs och levnadssätt

Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.

When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems.…They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.
Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.
Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige. Vi tänker stoppa maktöverföringen till Bryssel och bryta trenden där unionen gått från ett mellanstatligt samarbete mot allt mer överstatlighet och federalism. Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.

Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre. Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.

Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.

Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.
En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.

Vi tänker se till att var och en har tillgång till sjukvård i världsklass oavsett var i landet man bor. Därför behöver vi anställa betydligt fler händer i vården. Vi behöver också skjuta till medel för att åtgärda bristen på vårdplatser. Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.

Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.
surpass the Punchline Package includes, but Pasta is blame on I extensively trained in your moth
Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.

Vi tänker se till att var och en har tillgång till sjukvård i världsklass oavsett var i landet man bor. Därför behöver vi anställa betydligt fler händer i vården. Vi behöver också skjuta till medel för att åtgärda bristen på vårdplatser. Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.
För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.
Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.
fredsbevarande insatser där alla plan för att den svenska folket ska kunna bevara en GetPosition på mobilen
Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige. Vi tänker stoppa maktöverföringen till Bryssel och bryta trenden där unionen gått från ett mellanstatligt samarbete mot allt mer överstatlighet och federalism. Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.

En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.
Trenden inom offentlig sektor inte behöva vara rädd för asyl- och socialism finns till svenska löntagares intressen sätts i bakgrunden
a member of a club or society very strongly pro-Mexican,” a reporter asked Trump whether he would also feel that a Muslim could not treat him fairly because of his proposed Muslim ban. “It’s possible, yes
Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för ett Sverige med trygga och hälsosamma arbetsplatser. Ett Sverige med god tillgång på arbete där svenska löntagares intressen sätts i första rummet. Ett Sverige där man kan leva på sin lön och där vardagshjältarna inom offentlig sektor inte tvingas slita ut sig i förtid på grund av stress och underbemanning.
Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.
Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.

Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

syssla med ett substitut till hands och ekonomiska tillväxten eller att kulturen är den enskildes förmåga att upprätthålla högt ställda krav på bostadsmarknaden
Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.
Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.
självstyre betyder det svenska landsbygden i politiken och det krävs personalförstärkningar och djurskyddsmål

Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre.

Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.

Den äldre generationen som varit med och byggt upp vårt land ska ha möjlighet till en trygg och värdig ålderdom. Dagens situation är oanständig och det krävs att vi genomför rejäla satsningar både för att stärka pensionärernas ekonomi och trygghet.

I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.

Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.
I think there is blame on both sides.…You also had people that were very fine people on both sides.…Not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch.
Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.

Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.
Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.

Vi tänker se till att var och en har tillgång till sjukvård i världsklass oavsett var i landet man bor. Därför behöver vi anställa betydligt fler händer i vården. Vi behöver också skjuta till medel för att åtgärda bristen på vårdplatser. Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.

För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa.

Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.

Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.

Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.
Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.
Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.

En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.

För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas.

Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige. Vi tänker stoppa maktöverföringen till Bryssel och bryta trenden där unionen gått från ett mellanstatligt samarbete mot allt mer överstatlighet och federalism. Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.
Den äldre generationen som varit med och byggt upp vårt land ska ha möjlighet till en trygg och värdig ålderdom. Dagens situation är oanständig och det krävs att vi genomför rejäla satsningar både för att stärka pensionärernas ekonomi och trygghet. Inom äldreomsorgen krävs personalförstärkningar och kvalitetshöjningar. Den orättvisa pensionärsskatten avskaffar vi omedelbart om vi får inflytande under nästa mandatperiod.
Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.
Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre. Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.
Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.

Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.
Our inner cities, African Americans, Hispanics are living in hell because it’s so dangerous. You walk down the street, you get shot.
Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.

Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för ett Sverige med trygga och hälsosamma arbetsplatser. Ett Sverige med god tillgång på arbete där svenska löntagares intressen sätts i första rummet. Ett Sverige där man kan leva på sin lön och där vardagshjältarna inom offentlig sektor inte tvingas slita ut sig i förtid på grund av stress och underbemanning.
Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.

Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.

En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.
Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.

Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.
Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.
Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.
I think there is blame on both sides.…You also had people that were very fine people on both sides.…Not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch.
Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.

When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems.…They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.

Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.
Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.

Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.

Den äldre generationen som varit med och byggt upp vårt land ska ha möjlighet till en trygg och värdig ålderdom. Dagens situation är oanständig och det krävs att vi genomför rejäla satsningar både för att stärka pensionärernas ekonomi och trygghet. Inom äldreomsorgen krävs personalförstärkningar och kvalitetshöjningar. Den orättvisa pensionärsskatten avskaffar vi omedelbart om vi får inflytande under nästa mandatperiod.
Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.
Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.

En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.

För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.

Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.

Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.
I think there is blame on both sides.…You also had people that were very fine people on both sides.…Not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch.

total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.
Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.

Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre. Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.
Den äldre generationen som varit med och byggt upp vårt land ska ha möjlighet till en trygg och värdig ålderdom. Dagens situation är oanständig och det krävs att vi genomför rejäla satsningar både för att stärka pensionärernas ekonomi och trygghet. Inom äldreomsorgen krävs personalförstärkningar och kvalitetshöjningar. Den orättvisa pensionärsskatten avskaffar vi omedelbart om vi får inflytande under nästa mandatperiod.
Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.

Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.
Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för ett Sverige med trygga och hälsosamma arbetsplatser. Ett Sverige med god tillgång på arbete där svenska löntagares intressen sätts i första rummet. Ett Sverige där man kan leva på sin lön och där vardagshjältarna inom offentlig sektor inte tvingas slita ut sig i förtid på grund av stress och underbemanning.

Vi behöver också skjuta till medel för att åtgärda bristen på vårdplatser. Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.

Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.

Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.

Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.
They’re trying to take away our culture. They’re trying to take away our history. And our weak leaders, they do it overnight. These things have been there for 150 years, for a hundred years. You go back to a university and it's gone. Weak, weak people.

Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.

Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige. Vi tänker stoppa maktöverföringen till Bryssel och bryta trenden där unionen gått från ett mellanstatligt samarbete mot allt mer överstatlighet och federalism. Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.
Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.

En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.

Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.

Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre. Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.
Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för ett Sverige med trygga och hälsosamma arbetsplatser. Ett Sverige med god tillgång på arbete där svenska löntagares intressen sätts i första rummet. Ett Sverige där man kan leva på sin lön och där vardagshjältarna inom offentlig sektor inte tvingas slita ut sig i förtid på grund av stress och underbemanning.
Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.
Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.
Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.
Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.

Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.

Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.

Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige.

Den äldre generationen som varit med och byggt upp vårt land ska ha möjlighet till en trygg och värdig ålderdom. Dagens situation är oanständig och det krävs att vi genomför rejäla satsningar både för att stärka pensionärernas ekonomi och trygghet. Inom äldreomsorgen krävs personalförstärkningar och kvalitetshöjningar. Den orättvisa pensionärsskatten avskaffar vi omedelbart om vi får inflytande under nästa mandatperiod.
För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.

Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.

Den äldre generationen som varit med och byggt upp vårt land ska ha möjlighet till en trygg och värdig ålderdom. Dagens situation är oanständig och det krävs att vi genomför rejäla satsningar både för att stärka pensionärernas ekonomi och trygghet. Inom äldreomsorgen krävs personalförstärkningar och kvalitetshöjningar. Den orättvisa pensionärsskatten avskaffar vi omedelbart om vi får inflytande under nästa mandatperiod.

Vi tänker se till att var och en har tillgång till sjukvård i världsklass oavsett var i landet man bor. Därför behöver vi anställa betydligt fler händer i vården. Vi behöver också skjuta till medel för att åtgärda bristen på vårdplatser. Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.

Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige. Vi tänker stoppa maktöverföringen till Bryssel och bryta trenden där unionen gått från ett mellanstatligt samarbete mot allt mer överstatlighet och federalism. Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.
Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre. Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.
Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för ett Sverige med trygga och hälsosamma arbetsplatser. Ett Sverige med god tillgång på arbete där svenska löntagares intressen sätts i första rummet. Ett Sverige där man kan leva på sin lön och där vardagshjältarna inom offentlig sektor inte tvingas slita ut sig i förtid på grund av stress och underbemanning.
Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.

En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.

Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.
Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.
Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.

Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.

Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.

För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.

Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.

Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.

Vi tänker se till att var och en har tillgång till sjukvård i världsklass oavsett var i landet man bor. Därför behöver vi anställa betydligt fler händer i vården. Vi behöver också skjuta till medel för att åtgärda bristen på vårdplatser. Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.
Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.
When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems.…They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.
Well, just so you understand, I don’t know anything about David Duke, OK? I don’t know anything about what you’re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So I don’t know.
Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.

Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre. Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.

Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.
Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige. Vi tänker stoppa maktöverföringen till Bryssel och bryta trenden där unionen gått från ett mellanstatligt samarbete mot allt mer överstatlighet och federalism. Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.

Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.

Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.
Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för ett Sverige med trygga och hälsosamma arbetsplatser. Ett Sverige med god tillgång på arbete där svenska löntagares intressen sätts i första rummet. Ett Sverige där man kan leva på sin lön och där vardagshjältarna inom offentlig sektor inte tvingas slita ut sig i förtid på grund av stress och underbemanning.
Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.

Den äldre generationen som varit med och byggt upp vårt land ska ha möjlighet till en trygg och värdig ålderdom. Dagens situation är oanständig och det krävs att vi genomför rejäla satsningar både för att stärka pensionärernas ekonomi och trygghet. Inom äldreomsorgen krävs personalförstärkningar och kvalitetshöjningar. Den orättvisa pensionärsskatten avskaffar vi omedelbart om vi får inflytande under nästa mandatperiod.

För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.

Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.

Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.

En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.

Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.

Vi tänker se till att var och en har tillgång till sjukvård i världsklass oavsett var i landet man bor. Därför behöver vi anställa betydligt fler händer i vården. Vi behöver också skjuta till medel för att åtgärda bristen på vårdplatser. Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.
Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige. Vi tänker stoppa maktöverföringen till Bryssel och bryta trenden där unionen gått från ett mellanstatligt samarbete mot allt mer överstatlighet och federalism. Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.
En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande.

Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.

Our inner cities, African Americans, Hispanics are living in hell because it’s so dangerous. You walk down the street, you get shot.
Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.
Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för ett Sverige med trygga och hälsosamma arbetsplatser. Ett Sverige med god tillgång på arbete där svenska löntagares intressen sätts i första rummet. Ett Sverige där man kan leva på sin lön och där vardagshjältarna inom offentlig sektor inte tvingas slita ut sig i förtid på grund av stress och underbemanning.

Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.
Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.

Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.
Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.
Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

They’re trying to take away our culture. They’re trying to take away our history. And our weak leaders, they do it overnight. These things have been there for 150 years, for a hundred years. You go back to a university and it's gone. Weak, weak people.
Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.

Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre. Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.

Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.

Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.

Den äldre generationen som varit med och byggt upp vårt land ska ha möjlighet till en trygg och värdig ålderdom. Dagens situation är oanständig och det krävs att vi genomför rejäla satsningar både för att stärka pensionärernas ekonomi och trygghet. Inom äldreomsorgen krävs personalförstärkningar och kvalitetshöjningar. Den orättvisa pensionärsskatten avskaffar vi omedelbart om vi får inflytande under nästa mandatperiod.

Ett Sverige där man kan leva på sin lön och där vardagshjältarna inom offentlig sektor inte tvingas slita ut sig i förtid på grund av stress och underbemanning.
When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems.…They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.
Our inner cities, African Americans, Hispanics are living in hell because it’s so dangerous. You walk down the street, you get shot.
Den äldre generationen som varit med och byggt upp vårt land ska ha möjlighet till en trygg och värdig ålderdom. Dagens situation är oanständig och det krävs att vi genomför rejäla satsningar både för att stärka pensionärernas ekonomi och trygghet. Inom äldreomsorgen krävs personalförstärkningar och kvalitetshöjningar. Den orättvisa pensionärsskatten avskaffar vi omedelbart om vi får inflytande under nästa mandatperiod.

Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.

Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.
Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.

För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.
Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.
En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.
When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems.…They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.
Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.
They’re trying to take away our culture. They’re trying to take away our history. And our weak leaders, they do it overnight. These things have been there for 150 years, for a hundred years. You go back to a university and it's gone. Weak, weak people.

Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.

Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.
Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.
Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.

Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem.

Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.
Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

They’re trying to take away our culture. They’re trying to take away our history. And our weak leaders, they do it overnight. These things have been there for 150 years, for a hundred years. You go back to a university and it's gone. Weak, weak people.
Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.
Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.
Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för ett Sverige med trygga och hälsosamma arbetsplatser. Ett Sverige med god tillgång på arbete där svenska löntagares intressen sätts i första rummet. Ett Sverige där man kan leva på sin lön och där vardagshjältarna inom offentlig sektor inte tvingas slita ut sig i förtid på grund av stress och underbemanning.
Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige. Vi tänker stoppa maktöverföringen till Bryssel och bryta trenden där unionen gått från ett mellanstatligt samarbete mot allt mer överstatlighet och federalism. Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.
Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.
Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.

Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.
En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.

Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.
Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre. Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.

Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden.

Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.
För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.

Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.

Vi behöver också skjuta till medel för att åtgärda bristen på vårdplatser. Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.

Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.
Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.

Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.

En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.
Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre. Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.

Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.
They’re trying to take away our culture. They’re trying to take away our history. And our weak leaders, they do it overnight. These things have been there for 150 years, for a hundred years. You go back to a university and it's gone. Weak, weak people.
Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.

Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.

Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.

Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet.

Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.
Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre. Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.
Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.
Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.
Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.
Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.
Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.
Well, just so you understand, I don’t know anything about David Duke, OK? I don’t know anything about what you’re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So I don’t know.

Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.
Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för ett Sverige med trygga och hälsosamma arbetsplatser. Ett Sverige med god tillgång på arbete där svenska löntagares intressen sätts i första rummet. Ett Sverige där man kan leva på sin lön och där vardagshjältarna inom offentlig sektor inte tvingas slita ut sig i förtid på grund av stress och underbemanning.

En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.

För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.
I think there is blame on both sides.…You also had people that were very fine people on both sides.…Not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch.

Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige. Vi tänker stoppa maktöverföringen till Bryssel och bryta trenden där unionen gått från ett mellanstatligt samarbete mot allt mer överstatlighet och federalism. Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.

Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

Den äldre generationen som varit med och byggt upp vårt land ska ha möjlighet till en trygg och värdig ålderdom. Dagens situation är oanständig och det krävs att vi genomför rejäla satsningar både för att stärka pensionärernas ekonomi och trygghet. Inom äldreomsorgen krävs personalförstärkningar och kvalitetshöjningar. Den orättvisa pensionärsskatten avskaffar vi omedelbart om vi får inflytande under nästa mandatperiod.

Vi tänker se till att var och en har tillgång till sjukvård i världsklass oavsett var i landet man bor. Därför behöver vi anställa betydligt fler händer i vården. Vi behöver också skjuta till medel för att åtgärda bristen på vårdplatser. Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.

Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.

Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.
Look at my African American over here. Look at him.
They’re trying to take away our culture. They’re trying to take away our history. And our weak leaders, they do it overnight. These things have been there for 150 years, for a hundred years. You go back to a university and it's gone. Weak, weak people.
Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.
Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.

Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.

Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.

Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.
Den äldre generationen som varit med och byggt upp vårt land ska ha möjlighet till en trygg och värdig ålderdom. Dagens situation är oanständig och det krävs att vi genomför rejäla satsningar både för att stärka pensionärernas ekonomi och trygghet. Inom äldreomsorgen krävs personalförstärkningar och kvalitetshöjningar. Den orättvisa pensionärsskatten avskaffar vi omedelbart om vi får inflytande under nästa mandatperiod.

Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre. Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.

Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.
En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.
Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.

Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.

Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.

Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.
Our inner cities, African Americans, Hispanics are living in hell because it’s so dangerous. You walk down the street, you get shot.
Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige. Vi tänker stoppa maktöverföringen till Bryssel och bryta trenden där unionen gått från ett mellanstatligt samarbete mot allt mer överstatlighet och federalism. Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.
Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.
When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems.…They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.
Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre. Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.

I think there is blame on both sides.…You also had people that were very fine people on both sides.…Not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch.
They’re trying to take away our culture. They’re trying to take away our history. And our weak leaders, they do it overnight. These things have been there for 150 years, for a hundred years. You go back to a university and it's gone. Weak, weak people.

För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.
Well, just so you understand, I don’t know anything about David Duke, OK? I don’t know anything about what you’re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So I don’t know.
Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.

Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.
Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.

Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.

Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.
En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.

Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.

Vi tänker se till att var och en har tillgång till sjukvård i världsklass oavsett var i landet man bor. Därför behöver vi anställa betydligt fler händer i vården. Vi behöver också skjuta till medel för att åtgärda bristen på vårdplatser. Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.

Den äldre generationen som varit med och byggt upp vårt land ska ha möjlighet till en trygg och värdig ålderdom. Dagens situation är oanständig och det krävs att vi genomför rejäla satsningar både för att stärka pensionärernas ekonomi och trygghet. Inom äldreomsorgen krävs personalförstärkningar och kvalitetshöjningar. Den orättvisa pensionärsskatten avskaffar vi omedelbart om vi får inflytande under nästa mandatperiod.

Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.

I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.

Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre. Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.
Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.

Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för ett Sverige med trygga och hälsosamma arbetsplatser. Ett Sverige med god tillgång på arbete där svenska löntagares intressen sätts i första rummet. Ett Sverige där man kan leva på sin lön och där vardagshjältarna inom offentlig sektor inte tvingas slita ut sig i förtid på grund av stress och underbemanning.
Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.

Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.

total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.
They’re trying to take away our culture. They’re trying to take away our history. And our weak leaders, they do it overnight. These things have been there for 150 years, for a hundred years. You go back to a university and it's gone. Weak, weak people.
Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.

Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.

Den äldre generationen som varit med och byggt upp vårt land ska ha möjlighet till en trygg och värdig ålderdom. Dagens situation är oanständig och det krävs att vi genomför rejäla satsningar både för att stärka pensionärernas ekonomi och trygghet. Inom äldreomsorgen krävs personalförstärkningar och kvalitetshöjningar. Den orättvisa pensionärsskatten avskaffar vi omedelbart om vi får inflytande under nästa mandatperiod.

Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige. Vi tänker stoppa maktöverföringen till Bryssel och bryta trenden där unionen gått från ett mellanstatligt samarbete mot allt mer överstatlighet och federalism. Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.

En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.

Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap.

Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.

Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.

Vi tänker se till att var och en har tillgång till sjukvård i världsklass oavsett var i landet man bor. Därför behöver vi anställa betydligt fler händer i vården. Vi behöver också skjuta till medel för att åtgärda bristen på vårdplatser. Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.

Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.
I think there is blame on both sides.…You also had people that were very fine people on both sides.…Not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch.
Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.
When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems.…They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.
They’re trying to take away our culture. They’re trying to take away our history. And our weak leaders, they do it overnight. These things have been there for 150 years, for a hundred years. You go back to a university and it's gone. Weak, weak people.
Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.
Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige. Vi tänker stoppa maktöverföringen till Bryssel och bryta trenden där unionen gått från ett mellanstatligt samarbete mot allt mer överstatlighet och federalism. Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.

Vi tänker se till att var och en har tillgång till sjukvård i världsklass oavsett var i landet man bor. Därför behöver vi anställa betydligt fler händer i vården. Vi behöver också skjuta till medel för att åtgärda bristen på vårdplatser. Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.

Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.
Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.
Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.

Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.
Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.

En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.

Den äldre generationen som varit med och byggt upp vårt land ska ha möjlighet till en trygg och värdig ålderdom. Dagens situation är oanständig och det krävs att vi genomför rejäla satsningar både för att stärka pensionärernas ekonomi och trygghet. Inom äldreomsorgen krävs personalförstärkningar och kvalitetshöjningar. Den orättvisa pensionärsskatten avskaffar vi omedelbart om vi får inflytande under nästa mandatperiod.

Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.

Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.
Well, just so you understand, I don’t know anything about David Duke, OK? I don’t know anything about what you’re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So I don’t know.
I think there is blame on both sides.…You also had people that were very fine people on both sides.…Not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch.
Look at my African American over here. Look at him.

They’re trying to take away our culture. They’re trying to take away our history. And our weak leaders, they do it overnight. These things have been there for 150 years, for a hundred years. You go back to a university and it's gone. Weak, weak people.
Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.
Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.
Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.
Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige.

Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.
Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.

Our inner cities, African Americans, Hispanics are living in hell because it’s so dangerous. You walk down the street, you get shot.
Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre. Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.
Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.
En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.
When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems.…They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.
Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för ett Sverige med trygga och hälsosamma arbetsplatser. Ett Sverige med god tillgång på arbete där svenska löntagares intressen sätts i första rummet. Ett Sverige där man kan leva på sin lön och där vardagshjältarna inom offentlig sektor inte tvingas slita ut sig i förtid på grund av stress och underbemanning.

Den äldre generationen som varit med och byggt upp vårt land ska ha möjlighet till en trygg och värdig ålderdom. Dagens situation är oanständig och det krävs att vi genomför rejäla satsningar både för att stärka pensionärernas ekonomi och trygghet. Inom äldreomsorgen krävs personalförstärkningar och kvalitetshöjningar. Den orättvisa pensionärsskatten avskaffar vi omedelbart om vi får inflytande under nästa mandatperiod.
sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i sverige. vi tänker stoppa maktöverföringen till bryssel och bryta trenden där unionen gått från ett mellanstatligt samarbete mot allt mer överstatlighet och federalism. det eu-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det eu vi har idag. vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det eu som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.

För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.

Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.

Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.
Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.
Vi tänker se till att var och en har tillgång till sjukvård i världsklass oavsett var i landet man bor. Därför behöver vi anställa betydligt fler händer i vården.

Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.

Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.
Vi tänker se till att var och en har tillgång till sjukvård i världsklass oavsett var i landet man bor. Därför behöver vi anställa betydligt fler händer i vården. Vi behöver också skjuta till medel för att åtgärda bristen på vårdplatser. Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.
Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.
En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.
They’re trying to take away our culture. They’re trying to take away our history. And our weak leaders, they do it overnight. These things have been there for 150 years, for a hundred years. You go back to a university and it's gone. Weak, weak people.

Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.

Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.

Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder.

Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.

Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige.

Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.

Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.
Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.

Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige. Vi tänker stoppa maktöverföringen till Bryssel och bryta trenden där unionen gått från ett mellanstatligt samarbete mot allt mer överstatlighet och federalism. Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.
I think there is blame on both sides.…You also had people that were very fine people on both sides.…Not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch.

They’re trying to take away our culture. They’re trying to take away our history. And our weak leaders, they do it overnight. These things have been there for 150 years, for a hundred years. You go back to a university and it's gone. Weak, weak people.
Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.

Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.
Vi tänker se till att var och en har tillgång till sjukvård i världsklass oavsett var i landet man bor. Därför behöver vi anställa betydligt fler händer i vården. Vi behöver också skjuta till medel för att åtgärda bristen på vårdplatser. Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.

Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.

En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.

För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.

Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.
Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.

Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre. Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.

Den äldre generationen som varit med och byggt upp vårt land ska ha möjlighet till en trygg och värdig ålderdom. Dagens situation är oanständig och det krävs att vi genomför rejäla satsningar både för att stärka pensionärernas ekonomi och trygghet. Inom äldreomsorgen krävs personalförstärkningar och kvalitetshöjningar. Den orättvisa pensionärsskatten avskaffar vi omedelbart om vi får inflytande under nästa mandatperiod.

Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.

Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.

För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.

When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems.…They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.
Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för ett Sverige med trygga och hälsosamma arbetsplatser. Ett Sverige med god tillgång på arbete där svenska löntagares intressen sätts i första rummet. Ett Sverige där man kan leva på sin lön och där vardagshjältarna inom offentlig sektor inte tvingas slita ut sig i förtid på grund av stress och underbemanning.
Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.

En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.
I think there is blame on both sides.…You also had people that were very fine people on both sides.…Not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch.
Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.

Den äldre generationen som varit med och byggt upp vårt land ska ha möjlighet till en trygg och värdig ålderdom. Dagens situation är oanständig och det krävs att vi genomför rejäla satsningar både för att stärka pensionärernas ekonomi och trygghet. Inom äldreomsorgen krävs personalförstärkningar och kvalitetshöjningar. Den orättvisa pensionärsskatten avskaffar vi omedelbart om vi får inflytande under nästa mandatperiod.
Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.
Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.

Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.
They’re trying to take away our culture. They’re trying to take away our history. And our weak leaders, they do it overnight. These things have been there for 150 years, for a hundred years. You go back to a university and it's gone. Weak, weak people.

Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.

Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända.

Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.
They’re trying to take away our culture. They’re trying to take away our history. And our weak leaders, they do it overnight. These things have been there for 150 years, for a hundred years. You go back to a university and it's gone. Weak, weak people.
Vi tänker se till att var och en har tillgång till sjukvård i världsklass oavsett var i landet man bor. Därför behöver vi anställa betydligt fler händer i vården. Vi behöver också skjuta till medel för att åtgärda bristen på vårdplatser. Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.
I think there is blame on both sides.…You also had people that were very fine people on both sides.…Not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch.
Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige. Vi tänker stoppa maktöverföringen till Bryssel och bryta trenden där unionen gått från ett mellanstatligt samarbete mot allt mer överstatlighet och federalism. Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.
Well, just so you understand, I don’t know anything about David Duke, OK? I don’t know anything about what you’re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So I don’t know.

Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.
Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.

Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.

Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.

Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre. Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.

Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.
För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.

Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem.

Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.
Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.

På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.

Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för ett Sverige med trygga och hälsosamma arbetsplatser. Ett Sverige med god tillgång på arbete där svenska löntagares intressen sätts i första rummet. Ett Sverige där man kan leva på sin lön och där vardagshjältarna inom offentlig sektor inte tvingas slita ut sig i förtid på grund av stress och underbemanning.

En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.

Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.
Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.

Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige.

Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.
Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.
Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.
Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för ett Sverige med trygga och hälsosamma arbetsplatser. Ett Sverige med god tillgång på arbete där svenska löntagares intressen sätts i första rummet. Ett Sverige där man kan leva på sin lön och där vardagshjältarna inom offentlig sektor inte tvingas slita ut sig i förtid på grund av stress och underbemanning.

Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.

Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.
Vi tänker se till att var och en har tillgång till sjukvård i världsklass oavsett var i landet man bor. Därför behöver vi anställa betydligt fler händer i vården. Vi behöver också skjuta till medel för att åtgärda bristen på vårdplatser. Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.

Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre. Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.

En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.

För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas.

Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.

Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige. Vi tänker stoppa maktöverföringen till Bryssel och bryta trenden där unionen gått från ett mellanstatligt samarbete mot allt mer överstatlighet och federalism. Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.
En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.
För att Sverige ska kunna upprätthålla en hög internationell konkurrenskraft och levnadsstandard vill vi föra en energipolitik som säkerställer en prisvärd och tillförlitlig energiförsörjning för såväl hushåll som näringsliv och samtidigt tillgodose högt ställda krav på miljövänlighet. Vi behöver kärnkraften för att inte bli beroende av smutsig, europeisk kolkraft eller rysk gas. Alternativa energiformer såsom vindkraft och solkraft kan inte under överskådlig tid utgöra mer än komplement till kärn- och vattenkraft.
Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.
Look at my African American over here. Look at him.
Vi tänker se till att var och en har tillgång till sjukvård i världsklass oavsett var i landet man bor. Därför behöver vi anställa betydligt fler händer i vården. Vi behöver också skjuta till medel för att åtgärda bristen på vårdplatser. Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.
Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.
Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.
Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.

Jordbruk och skogsbruk utgör fundamentala pelare i den svenska ekonomin och bidrar till en levande och livskraftig landsbygd. Samtidigt sammanflätas jordbruk och skogsbruk både med ett kulturellt arv och med omistliga naturvärden, vilket ytterligare understryker dess viktiga roll för Sverige i allmänhet och landsbygden i synnerhet. Tyvärr ser vi att Sveriges självförsörjning av livsmedel har fallit dramatiskt, en utveckling som vi vill vända. Vi vill därför ha en politik som tar tillvara landsbygdens potential och vill genomföra en bred satsning på landsbygdens näringar. Vi vill att det ska vara attraktivt att leva, bo och verka på den svenska landsbygden. På så sätt kan vi minska utflyttningen och ta tillvara alla de ekonomiska och kulturella rikedomar som finns på den svenska landsbygden.
Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.
Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.
I think there is blame on both sides.…You also had people that were very fine people on both sides.…Not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch.
Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

Den äldre generationen som varit med och byggt upp vårt land ska ha möjlighet till en trygg och värdig ålderdom. Dagens situation är oanständig och det krävs att vi genomför rejäla satsningar både för att stärka pensionärernas ekonomi och trygghet. Inom äldreomsorgen krävs personalförstärkningar och kvalitetshöjningar. Den orättvisa pensionärsskatten avskaffar vi omedelbart om vi får inflytande under nästa mandatperiod.

Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.

det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. en minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. en översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.

Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.

vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. situationen i östersjön är alarmerande. vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. en stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.

Vi tänker se till att var och en har tillgång till sjukvård i världsklass oavsett var i landet man bor. Därför behöver vi anställa betydligt fler händer i vården. Vi behöver också skjuta till medel för att åtgärda bristen på vårdplatser. Vi tycker det är skamligt att människor i vårt land – inte minst pensionärer – ofta väljer bort att hämta ut mediciner på grund av att det är för dyrt. Därför tänker vi åtgärda det.
Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.

Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.
Sverigedemokraterna anser att kulturen har en central plats i politiken och i samhällsbygget. Kulturen skall vara livskraftig och till för alla. Vi eftersträvar särskilt att göra kulturen tillgänglig för barn, gamla och funktionshindrade. För oss är det också självklart att Sverige är unikt och att den svenska kulturen är unik och värd att bevara och belysa. Den gemensamma svenska kulturen är betydligt äldre än mångkulturen och vi vill särskilt belysa dess betydelse för det fredliga, demokratiska och solidariska välfärdssamhället vi lever i.

Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre. Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.
Den äldre generationen som varit med och byggt upp vårt land ska ha möjlighet till en trygg och värdig ålderdom. Dagens situation är oanständig och det krävs att vi genomför rejäla satsningar både för att stärka pensionärernas ekonomi och trygghet. Inom äldreomsorgen krävs personalförstärkningar och kvalitetshöjningar. Den orättvisa pensionärsskatten avskaffar vi omedelbart om vi får inflytande under nästa mandatperiod.
Well, just so you understand, I don’t know anything about David Duke, OK? I don’t know anything about what you’re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So I don’t know.
Sverigedemokraterna arbetar för att det svenska folket ska bestämma över vilka lagar och regler som ska gälla i Sverige. Vi tänker stoppa maktöverföringen till Bryssel och bryta trenden där unionen gått från ett mellanstatligt samarbete mot allt mer överstatlighet och federalism. Det EU-medlemskap som svenska folket tog ställning till 1994 är inte det EU vi har idag. Vi vill att svenska folket ska få ta ställning till det EU som vuxit fram i en ny folkomröstning.
En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.
Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.

det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. en minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. en översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.

Vi tycker att ett viktigt mått på ett gott samhälle är hur väl det tar hand om dem som är svaga och utsatta. Sverige bör ha ett djurskydd i världsklass. Genom att införa en särskild djurpolis kan vi undersöka och beivra olika typer av brott mot djurskyddslagstiftningen på ett kompetent och effektivt sätt. Eftersom vi vill ha en levande landsbygd och ett livskraftigt lantbruk med djurhållning tänker vi införa ett djurvälfärdsbidrag till näringsidkarna som motsvarar de kostnader som tillkommer för att upprätthålla högt ställda miljö och djurskyddsmål. I kombination med tuffa krav på importerade djurprodukter kommer detta att öppna upp för en välfungerande industri i kombination med ett djurskydd i världsklass.

Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

Vår miljöpolitik präglas av rationalitet och effektivitet. Vi ska göra insatser där de gör som störst nytta, och vi ska använda oss av de senaste och mest avancerade forskningsdata. Miljöpolitik och energipolitik har ett nära samband. Kärnkraft är den energiform som bäst kombinerar stabil, billig energiförsörjning och låg miljöpåverkan. Situationen i Östersjön är alarmerande. Vi behöver tillse att situationen där åtgärdas omedelbart. En stor klimatbov är de långa transporterna, inte minst av livsmedel. Vi vill möjliggöra för en större matproduktion i Sverige, mer ekologiskt och närodlat.
Undersökningar visar att svensk skola blir allt sämre. Borgerliga och socialdemokratiska regeringar har betraktat den som en experimentverkstad och låtit en ansvarslös invandringspolitik äta upp resurserna. Vi tänker skifta fokus mot ordning och kunskap. Vi tänker se till att skolan blir likvärdig oavsett var i landet man bor.

Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.

Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.

Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.

Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.

närmar sig trygg i flyktingarnas närområde
Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.

Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.

Tog bort det
<@177172371579469825>, Det är en fråga om anständighet och den enskildes självständighet att det ska gå att leva på sin lön. Därför tror vi på att när det är ekonomiskt ansvarsfullt bör skatten sänkas för vanligt folk. Vi behöver reformera Lagen om anställningsskydd. Unga människor behöver ofta framförallt få in en fot på arbetsmarknaden, medan anställningstrygghet och villkor blir viktigare ju äldre man blir. För den som blir arbetslös behövs en trygg omställningsförsäkring. I Sverige ska svenska regler gälla – även för arbetare från inom den Europeiska unionen. Vi vill föra en pragmatisk arbetsmarknadspolitik med fokus på rationalitet och effektivitet – utan ideologiska skygglappar.

Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.

Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde.

Sverigedemokraterna är ett trygghetsparti. Man ska kunna känna sig trygg i arbetslivet, trygg i skolan och trygg när man blir gammal. Men det allra viktigaste är kanske den fysiska tryggheten. Man ska inte behöva vara rädd för att bli utsatt för brottslighet vare sig hemma eller i offentliga miljöer. När brott ändå sker ska man kan kunna lita på att samhället gör sitt jobb. Att polisen finns till hands och löser brottet. Att myndigheterna finns till hands för att erbjuda brottsoffer stöd och hjälp. Att domstolen ger brottslingen ett rimligt straff, utdömer ett rimligt skadestånd och därmed också ger brottsoffret upprättelse. Vi konstaterar att det krävs åtgärder på alla plan för att uppnå detta.

Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.

Vi vill ha en flyktingpolitik som ser till Sveriges bästa samtidigt som vi hjälper så många flyktingar som möjligt. Det gör vi genom att begränsa invandringen till Sverige och istället använda resurserna i flyktingarnas närområde. På så sätt kan vi hjälpa fler människor än de andra partierna samtidigt som vi får resurser kvar för att stärka välfärden här hemma.
Det har helt saknats framförhållning i bostadspolitiken där antalet nyanlända invandrare legat långt över antalet byggda bostäder under många år. En minskad byråkrati kring byggprojekt och stärkning av kommunernas kompetens för byggprocessen skulle snabba på bostadsbyggandet. Genom bättre finansieringsmöjligheter för mindre byggbolag kan fler företag konkurrera på byggmarknaden vilket skulle leda till minskade byggkostnader och därmed boendekostnader. En översyn av privatpersoners möjlighet till finansiering av bostadsköp behövs. Detta kombinerat med en nollvision för asyl- och anhörighetsinvandring kommer på sikt att skapa balans på bostadsmarknaden.

<@177172371579469825>, Familjen med sin omhändertagande, kulturförmedlande och fostrande roll är samhällets viktigaste och mest grundläggande gemenskap. Starka och trygga familjer är en nödvändig förutsättning för harmoniska samhällsförhållanden. Politikens uppgift är att stötta familjerna utan att inkräkta på deras handlingsfrihet, men också att skapa starka skyddsnät och rycka ut till barnens stöd i de fall då föräldrarna sviker sitt ansvar eller då familjen av någon orsak faller sönder. Utgångspunkten för Sverigedemokraternas familjepolitik är att barnens bästa skall beaktas i alla situationer inom familjepolitikens område.

<@177172371579469825>, En varsam hantering av de gemensamma, ekonomiska resurserna är en viktig och naturlig del av den sverigedemokratiska förvaltarskapstanken. Sunda statsfinanser och respekt för målet om överskott i statens budget är en grundförutsättning för att långsiktigt kunna bevara en hög nivå av välfärd. Sverigedemokraterna betraktar äganderätten som en nödvändig förutsättning för en lyckosam samhällsutveckling. Vi förespråkar en reglerad, ansvarsfull marknadsekonomi. Tillväxt är nödvändigt för att kunna upprätthålla vår välfärd, men måste balanseras mot viktiga samhällsvärden såsom folkhälsa, kulturarv, miljö, socialt kapital och nationellt självbestämmande. Skatteuttaget får inte vara så lågt att det äventyrar statens möjligheter att värna utsatta grupper, hålla ihop samhället eller att erbjuda alla medborgare en hög grundläggande välfärdsnivå. Skatteuttaget får dock inte heller utformas på ett sådant sätt att det allvarligt begränsar den enskildes förmåga att klara sin egen försörjning, undanröjer incitamenten för att vilja bidra till den ekonomiska tillväxten eller påtagligt hämmar näringslivets konkurrenskraft.

<@177172371579469825>, Sverigedemokraterna menar att det är statens kärnuppgift att värna vår frihet och att hävda vår territoriella integritet och vi anslår därför kraftigt ökade medel till Försvarsmakten med målsättningen att nå en nivå av 2,5 % av BNP. Sveriges försvarspolitik ska fokusera på försvaret av Sverige. Genom att stärka vårt eget försvar, genom att fullt ut verka för ett nordiskt försvarssamarbete och genom partnerskapet för fred med NATO tar Sverige sitt säkerhetspolitiska ansvar. När Sverige återfått ett existensförsvar är det rimligt att Sverige åter bidrar med militärt bistånd i fredsskapande och fredsbevarande insatser med FN-mandat bakom. Det är en balanserad inställning långt från både isolationism och förlorad självständighet.

<@177172371579469825>, Sverigedemokraterna motsätter sig inte invandring men menar att invandringen måste hållas på en sådan nivå och vara av en sådan karaktär att den inte utgör ett hot mot vår nationella identitet eller mot vårt lands välfärd och trygghet. Invandring ska inte användas som ett substitut till riktig flyktinghjälp. Reglerna för anhöriginvandring måste vara utformade på ett sådant sätt att de inte bidrar till att skapa ökad segregation eller andra sociala och ekonomiska problem. Att av ekonomiska skäl tvingas stanna i ett land där man inte trivs och inte vill leva är destruktivt för såväl landet som för den enskilde individen. Ett aktivt och generöst stöd skall därför ges till de invandrare som önskar återvända till sina hemländer.

mellanled utan ett program som handlar om att befästa sina socialistiska teorier kallas monopolistisk kapitalism med de mest medvetna och ”skadliga” socialpolitiska åtgärder och 1977 fattade dessa länder i rätt och fackliga organiseringsgrad och med kompositioner inom fackföreningsrörelsen
Kommunisternas mål är det klasslösa samhället, vars huvudprincip sammanfattas i sentensen: ”av var och en efter förmåga – åt var och en efter behov”. Det klasslösa samhället kan förverkligas endast om människornas behov såväl materiellt som kulturellt till fullo kan tillgodoses. Därför måste det klasslösa, det kommunistiska samhället, byggas på en produktionsapparat på hög vetenskaplig och teknisk nivå. I det klasslösa samhället är alla människors frihet en förutsättning för den enskildes frihet, liksom den enskildes frihet är förutsättningen för allas frihet. I ett sådant samhälle kan det inte finnas fattiga och rika, egendomslösa och kapitalägare. Ett sådant samhälle måste helt genomsyras av den socialistiska demokratins, rättvisans och solidaritetens principer.
I en värld där kommunismens idéer har segrat blir Franska revolutionens paroll om frihet, jämlikhet och broderskap vägledande också i det internationella umgänget mellan folken i världen. När världens alla folk gemensamt bygger en värld i fred och välstånd tar mänskligheten det avgörande steget från nödvändighetens till frihetens rike.

Ett klasslöst samhälle kan inte förverkligas inom ramen för det kapitalistiska produktionssättet. Kommunisternas mål är att avskaffa kapitalismen och ersätta den med socialismen som öppnar vägen till vårt långsiktiga mål, det klasslösa kommunistiska samhället.
mänsklighetens överlevnadsfrågor
De socialistiska staternas nedmontering har flera orsaker. Sovjetunionen byggde ett alternativt samhällssystem som från första stund var utsatt för kapitalismens motattacker som nådde sin höjdpunkt i och med fascismens intervention och andra världskriget. Sovjetunionen spelade en avgörande roll i segern över fascismen men ofattbara förluster i människoliv och materiella resurser påverkade bygget av socialismen ännu långt efter kriget. Sovjetunionen och andra socialistiska länder med olika utvecklingsnivåer och historia slöt sig samman i en ekonomisk, utrikespolitisk och militär integration som motvikt till det kapitalistiska systemet. Det kalla kriget var imperialismens frontalangrepp mot den växande socialismen efter andra världskriget. Västs upprustning tvingade Sovjetunionen till kapprustning som slukade stora resurser. Försvaret av ett samhällsalternativ under de givna historiska omständigheterna förde även med sig en centralism där statssocialistiska lösningar ansågs vara bäst vilket försvårade initiativ underifrån. Partiet såg sin ledning i landet som självklar och inte som något som ständigt ska förvärvas på nytt. Så kunde kontrarevolutionen segra på grund av yttre och inre orsaker.
ideologiska plattform och utvidga den utbyggda välfärdsstaten
De produkter, tjänster och utvecklingsmöjligheter som varje individ behöver inkluderar en bra bostad till rimlig kostnad, kostnadsfri sjukvård och barnavård, ett rikt kulturellt utbud samt tillgång till hälsosam rekreation. I ett socialistiskt samhälle omfattar utbildningssystemet inte bara tillgång till kunskaper för alla oavsett ålder, kön, inkomst eller nationalitet utan också uppfostran i en anda av kamratskap, samarbete och ömsesidig respekt.

Vi kan utöver dessa för ett socialistiskt samhälle självklara förhållanden också dra lärdom av historien eftersom byggandet av socialismen har prövats tidigare. I och med den ryska oktoberrevolutionen 1917 påbörjades bygget av socialismen i Sovjetunionen. Mellan 1922 och början av 1990-talet fanns ett socialistiskt världssystem som i sitt slutskede omfattade 1,5 miljarder människor. Kontrarevolutionens seger i främst Europa har betytt en enorm belastning för arbetarrörelsen i hela världen. Imperialismens huvudkrafter fick och har än idag maximalt politiskt spelrum.
I dag deltar Sverige i ett världsomfattande produktionssystem som i hög grad är beroende av produkter från fattiga, underutvecklade länder. Därför måste ett socialistiskt strävande efter ett rättvist utbyte av produkter och tjänster omfatta dessa länder likaväl som Sverige. Folken i de nu exploaterade och förtrycka länderna i Afrika, Asien och Latinamerika måste också få rätt att bestämma över sin egen produktion och hur den skall användas och hur deras produkter ska distribueras. Handeln mellan Sverige och dessa länder måste ge ett ömsesidigt och likvärdigt utbyte. I ett socialistiskt samhälle är tillgång till de produkter, tjänster och utvecklingsmöjligheter som folken behöver för att leva ett värdigt liv en rättighet, inte ett privilegium. För det är folket självt som genom sitt arbete producerar dessa produkter och tjänster och skapar dessa möjligheter. Socialismen kommer att förändra människans behov från konsumism till sanna materiella och kulturella värden. För att kunna tillgodose dessa nya behov behövs tillväxt och därför är socialismens devis: ”av var och en efter förmåga, åt var och en efter prestation”. Konkurrensen som drivkraft kommer dock att ersättas av människans vilja till förändring och utveckling. Varje människa i ett socialistiskt samhälle har rätt och skyldighet till arbete. Arbetslöshet är alltså oförenlig med socialismen.
Kampen för en ny värld och ett bättre samhälle förs i huvudsak inom tre områden: politik, ekonomi och ideologi. Det ställer kommunisterna inför uppgiften att verka i de massorganisationer som det arbetande folket skapat för att tillvarata sina intressen; det gäller organisationer som ungdoms-, pensionärs- och miljöorganisationer samt konsumentrörelser och fackföreningar. Fackföreningarna har en särskild betydelse på grund av sin nära anknytning till produktionen, för det är i produktionen som vårt samhälleliga och sociala medvetande utformas i första hand. Vårt mål är att omvandla fackföreningarna till en aktiv kamporganisation. I dag ställer den ideologiska kampen höga krav på kommunisterna. Efter de kontrarevolutionära framgångarna i Östeuropa, de borgerliga mediemonopolens allt starkare grepp över informationen och likriktningen inom de parlamentariska grupperingarna blir det svårare att hitta skillnader, alla strävar efter någon tredje väg. Men en kapitalism med mänskligt ansikte eller en demokratisk kapitalism finns inte. Frågan är socialism eller barbari.

Ett starkt och välorganiserat kommunistiskt parti är inget självändamål, det är en förutsättning för att på ett vetenskapligt sätt, baserat på marxismen-leninismen, kunna delta i och vägleda den antikapitalistiska och antimonopolistiska kampen framåt och till seger. En huvuduppgift är därför att snarast möjligt bygga ut Sveriges Kommunistiska Parti organisatoriskt, ideologiskt och medlemsmässigt.
Kapitalismen varken vill eller kan lösa de problem som mänskligheten upplever, för detta krävs det klasslösa kommunistiska samhället. Det första steget mot ett klasslöst samhälle är att bygga ett socialistiskt samhälle. Till skillnad från det kapitalistiska samhället, som utgör en ’borgerlighetens diktatur’ där kapitalistklassen suger ut arbetarklassen, innebär proletariatets diktatur under socialismen, att arbetarklassen och folkflertalet tar över makten över samhället och förgör de gamla kapitalistiska strukturerna enligt vilka människor kan leva på att exploatera andra människor. Någon färdig modell för socialism finns inte. Socialismen kommer i varje land att hitta sin form utifrån de erfarenheter som arbetarklassens kamp och landets historiska utveckling har skapat. Dock finns det några grundläggande kännetecken för ett socialistiskt samhälle.
I det socialistiska samhället finns inga kapitalistiska ägandeförhållanden. Äganderätten till produktionsmedel, storföretag, banker samt finans- och försäkringsbolag överförs till de arbetande som är skapare av de materiella värdena. Äganderätten utövas genom offentliga institutioner under demokratisk kontroll och producenternas delaktighet i styrningen av företagen. Den socialistiska ekonomin är planerad. Den är långsiktig och hållbar och omfattar alla regioner liksom stad och landsbygd. Demokratin står alltid i den härskande klassens tjänst och därför kommer den socialistiska demokratin att stå i arbetarklassens tjänst.
Vårt parti har under hela sin existens ställt sig solidariskt till de försök att bygga socialismen som har gjorts. Vi ser ingen anledning att korrigera vår ideologi på grund av det inträffade. Att försöka ignorera eller förkättra de idéer och lösningar som de socialistiska länderna har utvecklat på alla samhällsområden innebär att beröva den framtida socialismen värdefull erfarenhet. Samtidigt lär vi oss av brister och misstag som har begåtts. Trots att våra motståndare under de senaste 20 åren har påstått att socialismen är död så vittnar vår och hela den världskommunistiska rörelsens existens om att socialismens idé lever. I Sydamerika har idén om social rättvisa och internationalism tagit konkret form i det kubanska samhället och i andra länder i regionen finns starka folkrörelser för socialistiska lösningar. Däremot har de ständigt återkommande kapitalistiska kriserna runt om i världen med förstörd produktionskapacitet, massarbetslöshet, armod och bostadsbrist som följd bevisat att kapitalismen är inne på sitt slutskede. Socialismen är den naturliga efterföljaren till detta system.

Sveriges Kommunistiska Parti fortsätter sitt arbete för socialism, den samhällsordning som inleddes när arbetarklassen för första gången tog makten genom den ryska oktoberrevolutionen.
Monopolkapitalets ständigt ökande ackumulations- och profitbehov förorsakar krig och exploatering av världens folk men vägrar ta ansvar för följderna. I stället låter man extremhögern komma till tals som kräver flyktingstopp och förföljelse av invandrare, det vill säga en omänsklig behandling av de redan utsatta. Dessa krafter fyller två viktiga funktioner. De riktar det arbetande folkets välgrundade missnöje med högerpolitikens nedmontering av välfärdssamhället mot ett för kapitalet ofarligt område. Deras mer eller mindre öppet rasistiska retorik får dessutom den liberala högerns arbetarfientliga och internationellt osolidariska propagering för arbetskraftsinvandring att framstå som progressiv och human.

Den internationella situationen domineras av den fördjupade globala krisen för kapitalismen och understryker kapitalismens historiska begränsningar och behovet av dess revolutionära störtande. Den grundläggande motsättningen under kapitalismen, den mellan produktionens samhälleliga karaktär och det kapitalistiska tillägnandet av vinsten, fördjupas. Dessa motsättningar kan enbart lösas genom en intensifierad klasskamp, kollektiv kamp av alla delar av det arbetande folket, såväl de som uppfattar sig som tjänstemän och de som i traditionell mening betraktar sig som arbetarklass. Kapitalismens grundläggande motsättningar kan inte lösas individuellt.
Den antimonopolistiska och antiimperialistiska fronten kan inte skapas genom att kommunisterna anpassar sin ideologi till den borgerliga politiken för att vinna villrådiga skikt. Tvärtom förutsätter den att de ideologiska skillnaderna klargörs och att antikommunismen avslöjas som verktyg för monopolens profitintressen. Därför ser partiet som sin uppgift att som en del av den antimonopolistiska, demokratiska rörelsen verka för enighet på basis av partiets ideologiska plattform och att göra det i såväl parlamentariska församlingar som utomparlamentariska rörelser. Partiet ser skapandet av en antimonopolistisk rörelse och utvidgad demokrati som vägen fram för att skapa en aktiv folkmajoritet som inskränker och slutligen krossar monopolkapitalets makt och öppnar vägen för övergången till socialismen, där alla ekonomiska resurser planeras efter sociala behov i stället för maximal profit åt fåtalet.
arbetssätt är bönderna
Under rådande kapitalistiska förhållanden, under dess imperialistiska stadium, berövas tre fjärdedelar av mänskligheten alla utvecklingsmöjligheter. Dessa människors hemländer spelar på den kapitalistiska världsmarknaden endast rollen som leverantörer av billiga råvaror, billig arbetskraft, som marknader för massprodukter och som semester- och rekreationsområden. Tillsammans med imperialismens krig förorsakar detta oändliga flyktingströmmar varav endast en bråkdel når Sverige.
Strävan efter fred, ett harmoniskt förhållande mellan människan och naturen, ekonomiskt välstånd och social rättvisa, internationell solidaritet, en humanistisk människosyn och utvidgad demokrati förenar även människor utanför arbetarklassen. Dessa sociala grupper och enskilda står objektivt i motsättning till det rådande fåtalsväldet i produktionslivet, till profitintresset som styrande faktor inom livets alla områden, till militarismen och imperialismen, till rovdrift på jordens naturresurser, till kommersialiseringen av kulturlivet och den allmänna avhumaniseringen av mänskliga relationer, som utmärker dagens kapitalism. I den kampen vill partiet i enlighet med sin grundsyn utveckla ett samarbete mellan alla politiska, fackliga och andra rörelser och krafter som verkar för att lösa dessa mänsklighetens överlevnadsfrågor. Kampen för dessa allmänmänskliga intressen står i samklang med arbetarklassens klassintressen och i motsättning till de kapitalistiska monopolen. Huvudkraften i en sådan antimonopolistisk rörelse är arbetarklassen som är den viktigaste samhällsförändrande kraften. Arbetarklassens kärna måste skapa allianser med sociala skikt, som beroende på den breda differentieringen av arbetarklassen och kapitalets kontroll och hegemoni över massmedia, präglas av villrådighet och till och med ställningstaganden som direkt motverkar de egna intressena.
För att Sverige ska kunna bevara sin självständighet, kunna stå utanför krig och bidra till lösningar av internationella konflikter, utveckla samarbete med världens övriga folk på basis av respekt och likaberättigande, fördjupa demokratin och förbättra de mångas levnadsstandard måste landet stå utanför EU. Sverige måste avveckla samarbetet med de av monopolen behärskade imperialistiska institutionerna som NATO och IMF med flera. Sverige ska inte heller medverka till en utvidgning av den kontroll och övervakning av medborgarna som främst USA och EU har utvecklat under paroller som krig mot terrorismen och kamp mot den grova brottsligheten. Den riktar sig främst mot arbetarrörelsen och andra som motsätter sig monopolens och imperialismens brott och krigsförberedelser. Partiet vill samverkan med andra krafter vilka också inser faran av ett svenskt medlemskap i EU, smyganslutningen till NATO och ingrepp i den personliga integriteten.
verket är att hemföra svenska kvinnor, som slog till framgång endast lösas genom vart och å andra Theodor Adorno, Charles Rosen, och arbetsköparnas försök gå från både Brahms och verket är möjlig om en mindre bestämmanderätt att de arbetande folket lyckades man gå från senromantiken under hela samhället vi tänker och individuell lönesättning försvagat klassmedvetandet
Partiet utvecklar därför en antimonopolistisk strategi. Monopolens maktpositioner måste övertas av samhälleliga organ och ställas under demokratisk ledning och kontroll. Det förutsätter nationalisering av de privata bankerna, kreditinstituten och försäkringsbolagen, energisektorn och de viktigaste råvarukällorna, de viktigaste produktionsmonopolen samt krigsmaterielproduktionen vilken omställs för tillverkning av produkter för fredliga ändamål. Detta skulle ge Sverige en stark och respekterad ställning i världen, såväl ekonomiskt som politiskt. Kungadömet är en rest från feodalsamhället och bör avskaffas.
Den ekonomiska kris som slog till runt om i världen i slutet av år 2008 har på ett tydligt sätt blottat det kapitalistiska produktionssättets gränser. Men kapitalet har sin vana trogen försökt att lägga skulden för krisen på för långtgående och ”skadliga” socialpolitiska åtgärder och enskilda giriga bankirer. Syftet har varit att omintetgöra alla de landvinningar som arbetarklassen tillkämpat sig under de senaste årtiondena och att få det arbetande folket att betala för kapitalets minskande profiter under krisen genom att påstå att vi alla sitter i samma båt.
I en tid av skärpta imperialistiska motsättningar, framdrivna av monopolkapitalets behov att föröka sig, är det av avgörande vikt att arbetarklassen världen över på allvar tar sig an frågan om socialismen i varje land. Det är bara socialismen som borgar för en värld av fred och fortsatt utveckling i folkflertalets intresse. Kampen mot monopolkapitalen, för övertagandet av produktionsmedel och naturresurser i Sverige, måste utföras av Sveriges arbetarklass. Sveriges Kommunistiska Parti har som främsta uppgift att leda denna kamp genom att organisera de mest medvetna och kampvilliga delarna av arbetarklassen.
Sverige har upplevt protester och motstånd mot olika sidor av det kapitalistiska samhället. Vi har varit delaktiga i gruvstrejken i Malmfälten, i vård- och lärarstrejker. Antikrigsrörelser har uppstått för Vietnam, Irak och Afghanistan. Pensionärsorganisationer driver enade aktioner för pensionärernas rättigheter och Hyresgästföreningen försvarar Allmännyttan. Gamla och nya folkrörelser är kritiska röster för förändring. Globaliseringsmotståndare, antimilitarister och feminister, miljö-, naturskydds- och djurrättsaktivister, biståndsvolontärer och kulturarbetare sätter viktiga frågor på dagordningen.
den kommer ju säga saker nu
skps fucking partiprogram tar ju för fan aldrig slut
Sverige har i likhet med andra EU-stater ställt om sitt försvar från invasionsförsvar till insatsförsvar. Invasionsförsvaret utgick från en felaktig hotbild om en fara från öster. Den nya doktrinen gör Sverige till bundsförvant med NATO-länder, delaktigt under ett kärnvapenparaply och krigförande långt utanför Europas gränser. Smyganslutningen till NATO genom Partnerskap för fred och Värdlandsavtalet drar det officiellt alltjämt alliansfria Sverige allt närmare NATO trots att samtliga opinionsundersökningar bekräftar det svenska folkets NATO-motstånd. Alla påståenden till trots har inte USA skaffat sig en ny huvudfiende i ”terrorismen”. Huvudfiende är och förblir krafter och stater som förverkligar eller eftersträvar ett socialistiskt samhällssystem. Antikommunismen har funnit nya måltavlor i länder i Asien och Latinamerika samtidigt som den drabbar rörelser och enskilda världen över.
havs, i det kommunistiska partiet den mytomspunna tyska män i Sverige i första årtionde kom att dominera den härskande klassens this pekaren ser bra ut även den borgerliga statens makt förenades med att han övergett bestämda tonarter, en ny filosofi på stora delar eller ifrågavarande nation gentemot de imperialistiska huvudmakternas krigsinstrument, i dag finns inom den industriella produktionens växande omfattning i den marxistiska teorin växte fram ett överstatligt organ och ett tryggt liv
innefattar en växande roll som nu Mirris
Som konsekvens av kontrarevolutionens seger i det forna socialistiska blocket i Europa i början på 1990-talet, gick världen in i en reaktionär fas, både ekonomiskt och ideologiskt. Med hela den borgerliga propagandaapparaten till sitt förfogande förde kapitalet fram åsikten att kollektiva samhälleliga lösningar var felaktiga. Den offentliga sektorn påstods ha blivit ett monstrum av ineffektivitet, en tärande sektor. Lösningen blev att privatiseringar och nedskärningar som påbörjats på 1980-talet kom att accelerera och kapitalet fick allt starkare makt. Med sitt ideologiska övertag över det arbetande folket lyckades kapitalet att få en majoritet att säga ja till ett medlemskap i den Europeiska Unionen i folkomröstningen som hölls 1994. Nej till EU-rörelsen förlorade striden men vann senare en seger i folkomröstningen om euron. Vårt medlemskap i EU som är ett överstatligt organ och bygger på de så kallade ”fyra friheterna” har lett till att den nyliberala politiken inte endast har blivit vägledande utan också permanent. Detta i sin tur har lett till att Sveriges riksdag och regering har fått mindre bestämmanderätt att forma landets politik.
Sverige har på 1900-talet hållit sig utanför två världskrig och efter 1945 bestämt sig för neutralitet och alliansfrihet som utrikespolitiska hörnpelare. Trots Sveriges principiella uppslutning kring västvärlden och en antikommunistisk grundinställning har alliansfriheten och närheten till den Alliansfria rörelsen varit av betydelse för att kunna dämpa imperialismens strävan att få bort det socialistiska samhällssystemet från världskartan. Med inträdet i Europeiska Unionen har Sverige anslutit sig till ett av imperialismens centra i världen. Medlemskapet likriktar Sverige med övriga EU-medlemmar. EU:s gemensamma försvars- och säkerhetspolitik har möjliggjort för de svenska monopolkapitalisterna att överge sin tidigare hycklande inställning till neutralitetspolitik och alliansfrihet till förmån för öppen krigshets och utökade militärbudgetar.
På 50 år har Sveriges befolkning förändrats så att den i dag till 20 procent består av utlandsfödda medborgare och deras barn. Över hela världen ökar flyktingströmmar och arbetsmigration, förorsakade av den ojämna globala utvecklingen. Kolonialism, nykolonialism och imperialistisk utrikes- och militärpolitik har lett och leder till misär, destabilisering och krig och innebär tragedier för miljontals människor. Det är de kapitalistiska länderna själva som har skapat denna förvrängda värld som nu också skapar problem för de länder som till stor del bygger sin rikedom på andra länders fattigdom. Kapitalismens oförmåga att kunna ge arbete och trygghet till varken infödda eller invandrade medborgare skapar motsättningar, främlingsfientlighet och rasism överallt där det brister i förståelse av sammanhangen. Ett resultat är att ett högerpopulistiskt, främlingsfientligt parti med fascistiska rötter kunde ta sig in i den svenska riksdagen.
Kvinnornas tillträde till arbetsmarknaden efter andra världskriget är en viktig faktor för samhällsutvecklingen. Kvinnlig arbetskraft kom att dominera den reproduktiva sektorn som utbildning, vård och omsorg samt detaljhandel. Föreställningen om att kvinnorna i anställning i princip gör samma sak som de tidigare utfört i hemmen ledde till låga löner och låglöneområden finns kvar än i dag. Sverige har i dag en hög andel förvärvsarbetande kvinnor men förändringarna i den offentliga sektorn har gjort många kvinnor till offer med otrygga anställningar. Kvinnornas växande självmedvetenhet och klassmedvetenhet tar sig uttryck i samhällelig aktivitet i allmänhet, fackligt engagemang, fortbildningsintresse och viljan att förena arbete, barn och familj. Brist på jämställdhet mellan kvinnor och män i samhället har också lett till en ny våg av feminism. Bristande jämställdhet kan emellertid inte bekämpas med en ny ism utan med förståelse för det dialektiska sambandet mellan kvinnokamp och klasskamp.
Naturen måste berövas sin strategi och raserar den marxistiska teorin växte fram och därmed marknaden
Som överallt så finns en klassaspekt även i den mångetniska verkligheten. Oavsett härkomst har arbetarklassen en gemensam motståndare. Sveriges Kommunistiska Parti verkar för ett ömsesidigt solidariskt förhållande mellan arbetande människor av olika ursprung och hävdar alla människors lika värde. På sikt kan problemen med den globala folkvandringen endast lösas genom en ny ekonomisk världsordning, där tredje världens länder befriat sig från det imperialistiska oket, som innefattar en utveckling av de underutvecklade länderna i överensstämmelse med deras egna behov.
Socialdemokratin övergav sin strategi att stegvis reformera det kapitalistiska samhället fram till ett socialistiskt. I stället myntades parollen om den utbyggda välfärdsstaten. Reformer som allmän sjukförsäkring, barnbidrag, allmän tjänstepension och växande reallöner var till gagn för arbetarklassen. Men denna utveckling bröts på 1970-talet. Kristecken med växande arbetslöshet, reallöneförsämringar och ökande klassklyftor framträdde allt tydligare i alla utvecklade kapitalistiska länder och även i Sverige. Samtidigt startade högerkrafterna en offensiv för att bevara sina positioner.
2010-talet har sett accelererande imperialistiska motsättningar över hela världen med fortsatt kapprustning, krig och konflikter samt ett underliggande hot om ett nytt imperialistiskt världskrig. Eftersom de imperialistiska motsättningarna kommer sig av ett inbyggt behov hos monopolkapitalet att växa, kan inga ’tyglande’ reformer i de kapitalistiska länderna eller inom Förenta Nationerna (FN) skapa fred på längre sikt. Den enda lösningen står istället att finna i socialismen, där själva drivkraften för de imperialistiska krigen, profitjakten, oskadliggörs. Kampen mot imperialismen blir inget annat än ett tomt skal (Lenin: Imperialismen som kapitalismens högsta stadium) såvida den inte förenas med kampen mot opportunismen. Genom krig och förtryck av svagare nationer skaffar sig monopolen extraprofiter och får därigenom ekonomisk möjlighet att korrumpera vissa skikt av arbetare, tidvis till och med en rätt betydande minoritet och dra över dom på borgerlighetens sida inom ifrågavarande industrigren eller ifrågavarande nation gentemot de övriga.
Efter andra världskriget byggdes den statsmonopolistiska regleringen av ekonomin ut i Sverige, samtidigt som koncentrationen och centraliseringen av kapital tilltog. Den ekonomiska makten koncentrerades till allt färre händer. Till denna utveckling bidrog statens nya uppgifter. Kreditpolitik, handelspolitik, statlig planering, regionalpolitik, arbetsmarknadspolitik, lönepolitik, utbildning och forskning underordnades monopolföretagens krav. Socialdemokratin ställde sig till förfogande för den statsmonopolistiska regleringen.
Den ekonomiska tillväxt som utmärkte tiden efter andra världskriget och fram till 1960-talets slut berodde på att Sverige inte var förstört av kriget. Den vetenskaplig-tekniska revolutionen fick tidigt fotfäste. Gynnsam ekonomi, arbetarnas höga fackliga organiseringsgrad och kampvilja och ett nytt styrkeförhållande i världen genom ett socialistiskt världssystem tvingade kapitalet att välja en klasskompromiss.
Säkerhetssituationen i världen som många ville se i ljusa färger på 1990-talet närmar sig nya katastrofer. Kärnvapenmakterna håller fast vid sina försvarsdoktriner där kärnvapen är den främsta säkerhetsgarantin. USA leder rustningspolitiken med en gigantisk militärbudget och nya vapentyper. NATO är de imperialistiska huvudmakternas krigsinstrument, i första hand USA:s redskap för det eftersträvade världsherraväldet. Världen befinner sig i en ny kapprustning som nu också omfattar rymden. I början av 2000-talet kom den kapitalistiska huvudmakten USA:s ekonomi i fundamental obalans genom å ena sidan hög statsskuld, forcerad upprustning och krig i Afghanistan och Irak och å andra sidan arbetarklassens utarmning med sjunkande konsumtionsförmåga i ett överproduktionssamhälle. En kasinoliknande spekulationsekonomi sökte sin tillflykt till en lånemarknad som skulle stimulera konsumtionsförmågan men i stället kom att ruinera stora delar av arbetarklassen. Den globaliserade ekonomin gjorde att problemen spillde över till resten av världen. Ett decennium senare ligger en ny kapitalistisk världskris, som är en systemkris, i öppen dager.
Socialismens nedmontering i Europa har till följd att den kapitalistiska ekonomin sedan 1900-talets slut ser globala möjligheter att befästa sina imperialistiska maktpositioner. I främsta rummet står USA som bygger ett totalt herravälde till lands, till havs, i luften och i rymden. I dag finns ett motstånd mot ett sådant herravälde kvar i Asien och i växande omfattning i Latinamerika. Inringningen av förra Sovjetunionen står kvar och utökas nu med en inringning av Kina. I början av 1990-talet deklarerade USA att man inte accepterar någon utmaning av makten. Det är grunden till den samlade imperialismens aktuella Kinapolitik på alla områden. Eftersom imperialismens ekonomiska beroende av Kina samtidigt ökar, är en destabilisering av landet ett förstahandsintresse för aktörerna.
Under de nya globaliserade förutsättningarna har en våg av privatiseringar svept över världen. Statens roll som ägare och företagare håller på att avvecklas. Därmed försvinner viktiga samhälleliga inkomstkällor och möjligheter att utöva demokratiskt inflytande. Samtidigt finns det i dag många former av statligt stöd till monopolen, till exempel skattelättnader och subventioner, forskning och utveckling i näringslivets intresse samt internationellt agerande på uppdrag av monopolen. Under globaliseringens förutsättningar behöver kapitalet internationella regleringssystem för att kunna kontrollera och balansera den kapitalistiska världsekonomin. Organisationer som Internationella valutafonden, Världsbanken, Världshandelsorganisationen, G7 respektive G8 har som uppgift att förverkliga det internationella monopolkapitalets gemensamma intressen. Samtidigt är de arenor för hård konkurrens. Vid sidan av dessa globala organisationer skapar monopolkapitalet sina regionala maktinstrument. I Europa är detta instrument den Europeiska Unionen (EU).
herregud
Den snabba utvecklingen av vetenskap och teknik, i synnerhet inom informations-, kommunikations- och transportteknologin under de senaste decennierna, har öppnat nya möjligheter för den kapitalistiska expansionen och en globalisering. Dessutom har den revolutionära arbetarrörelsens nederlag inneburit en direkt maktökning för kapitalismen i världen.
I snabb takt rivs i dag de återstående skyddsvallarna för de nationella marknaderna. Ekonomin internationaliseras i raskt tempo vilket inskränker och raserar den nationella politikens möjligheter. Dessa ekonomiska processer och deras politiska, kulturella och sociala följder sammanfattas i dag med begreppet globalisering. Globaliseringen är imperialismens konkreta form i vår tid.
I slutet av 1800-talet började den fria konkurrensen att ersättas av koncentration och monopolisering av industriproduktionen, en utveckling som påskyndades av de allvarliga kriser som drabbade kapitalet mellan 1890 och 1903. Denna koncentration ledde till att storföretag behärskade stora delar eller till och med hela produktionen inom en gren och därmed marknaden. Detta lade grunden för monopolen som i dag dominerar produktions- och ägarförhållanden. Parallellt skedde en koncentration av bankkapitalet. Från att ha varit ett mellanled utan aktiv roll engagerar sig nu bankerna överallt i ekonomin och deras maktposition blir i många fall starkare än industrikapitalets. En sammansmältning av bankkapital och industrikapital sker och en finansoligarki skapas. Denna finansoligarki som från början bestod av några hundra personer i de mest utvecklade staterna krympte till ett fåtal som kontrollerar hela det kapitalistiska samhället.
Under den fria konkurrensen kännetecknades kapitalismen av export av varor men den moderna kapitalismens särdrag är kapitalexport på grund av för stor ackumulation. Kapitalexporten varierar men brukar kännetecknas av lån eller investeringar med handelsmässiga, politiska eller militära krav.
Att skapa en enhetlig, självständig och stridbar fackföreningsrörelse är ett klassintresse. Den fackliga splittringen i LO och TCO bidrar till föreställningar att de båda organisationerna organiserar olika klasser. En gemensam facklig organisation kan lättare formulera krav för arbetarklassen i sin helhet. Klassmodellen blir allt tydligare och klassklyftorna allt djupare. Idag ägs 70 % av Stockholmsbörsen av 15 finansfamiljer samtidigt som den relativa fattigdomen breder ut sig. Klassklyftorna ökar snabbare än någonsin.
Samtidigt skedde en ekonomisk och politisk uppdelning av världen genom att monopolen blev internationella; en union mellan finansoligarki och politiker skapades. Monopolens makt och statens makt förenades till statsmonopolistisk kapitalism. Staten tillhandahåller de repressiva medlen som behövs för att förverkliga kapitalets intressen och använder dessa för att undertrycka motstånd. Det är statens funktion att säkra den härskande klassens makt, antingen genom överenskommelse eller genom tvång. Detta stadium kallas monopolistisk kapitalism eller imperialism. Lenin karaktäriserade imperialismen som kapitalismens högsta stadium.
Det finns klasser, skikt inom klasserna och grupper mellan klasserna. Olika skikt finns inom arbetarklassen vare sig det handlar om produktion, cirkulation, tjänstesektor eller reproduktion som skola, vård och omsorg. Det kan handla om väsentliga skillnader hos de olika skikten när det gäller utbildning, lön och inflytande över den egna arbetssituationen. Det borgerliga samhället odlar föreställningen om en medelklass som självständig klass och mörklägger därmed det grundläggande utsugningsförhållandet. Att få lönearbetare att inse detta och sin plats i det kapitalistiska systemet är en avgörande förutsättning för ökad klassmedvetenhet. Att växa upp i en metallarbetarfamilj för att senare utbilda sig till dataingenjör innebär ingen klassresa. En klassresa gör den som växlar från att ha varit arbetstagare till att bli arbetsköpare eller omvänt. Grupper mellan klasserna utgör inte heller någon medelklass utan uppvisar drag av både exploatörer och exploaterade. Till dessa kan räknas småborgerliga grupper på landsbygden och i städerna, småföretagare och högre tjänstemän med närhet till den härskande klassen. Intelligentian utgör enligt marxismen ingen klass utan ett socialt skikt som i varje samhällssystem bildas ur olika klasser.
Arbetarklassen är ett barn av den industriella revolutionen. Dess tillväxt är förknippad med den industriella produktionens växande roll i samhället. Redan under 1900-talets första årtionde kom arbetarklassen i Sverige, lantarbetarna inbegripna, att omfatta en majoritet av befolkningen och har sedan dess fortsatt att växa. Från att i ett tidigt skede huvudsakligen ha utgjorts av arbetare inom bas- och råvaruproduktionen och sedan inom tillverkningsindustrin har ett halvt sekels vetenskapliga och tekniska utveckling, en växande tjänstesektor och en växande offentlig sektor radikalt ändrat arbetarklassens sammansättning. Arbetarklassen har förändrats när det gäller arbetsuppgifter, kvalifikation, arbetsproduktivitet, könssammansättning, ursprungsland och klassmedvetenhet. Det har uppstått olika skikt inom arbetarklassen som utvecklar olika sociala mönster och levnadssätt. Ingen skiktning kan emellertid sudda ut det grundläggande förhållande som innebär att de löneanställda säljer sin arbetskraft och skapar mervärde åt arbetsköparen. Däremot är klassmedvetenheten inte enhetlig. Industriarbetare har i regel en starkare klassmedvetenhet på grund av kollektivt arbete, solidaritet på stora arbetsplatser och gemensamma erfarenheter av konfrontation med arbetsköparna. Även hos arbetskraften inom nya högteknologiska grenar och på kvinnodominerade arbetsplatser finns ofta en medvetenhet om samhällets beroende av dess arbetsinsats. Samtidigt har tillströmning av nya skikt med lägre erfarenhet av klasskampen och arbetsköparnas försök till splittring genom hög arbetslöshet, otrygga arbetsplatser och individuell lönesättning försvagat klassmedvetandet. Kapitalismens privatiseringssträvanden rycker loss allt fler människor ur det kollektiva sammanhang som fasta anställningar innebär. För många är ”att öppna eget” enda alternativet.
räddningsaktioner för en historisk roll, att på aktuella frågor
spelade partiet från 1923 och verket är inställd på ett program som dessa klasser finns mellangrupper vars första decennier senare Vänsterpartiet Kommunisterna (VPK) och i Tyskland skulle efterlevas eller omvänt
Sverige är ett klassamhälle. Med klass menas stora grupper av människor som står i ett visst förhållande till produktionsmedlen, har en bestämd plats i ett samhälleligt produktionssystem. De två huvudklasserna i det kapitalistiska Sverige är kapitalistklassen som äger produktionsmedlen och arbetarklassen som inte äger produktionsmedel. En krympande klass är bönderna. Antalet självägande bönder sjunker medan agrarstordriften ökar, men enskilda bönder är fortfarande betydande mark- och skogsägare. Utöver dessa klasser finns mellangrupper vars karaktär kan härledas från dessa klasser.

Arbetarklassen skapar värden som kapitalistklassen, åberopande sitt ägande, tillägnar sig. Detta kallar marxismen-leninismen för motsättningen mellan kapital och arbete och ser denna motsättning som antagonistisk, det vill säga oförsonlig. Motsättningen kan bara upphävas när den arbetande klassen äger produktionsmedlen. Då går mervärdet inte till privata ägare utan till hela samhället. Där börjar vägen till det klasslösa samhället. Båda klassernas sammansättning ändras historiskt med förändringen av produktionsförhållanden. Inom kapitalistklassen finns enskilda företagsägare, gruppägande i aktiebolagsform, finansoligarki och transnationellt agerande storföretag.
Under andra världskrigets slutskede ledde Folke Bernadotte flera räddningsaktioner för Röda Korset. Höstarna 1943 och 1944 organiserade han krigsfångeutbyte, där 11 000 krigsfångar fick återvända till sina hemländer via Sverige. Från februari 1945 var han i Tyskland och träffade då Heinrich Himmler, som blivit befälhavare för hela armén efter attentatet mot Hitler året innan. Folke Bernadotte hade ursprungligen i uppdrag av regeringen att sammanföra norska och danska politiska fångar i Tyskland. Han tog hjälp av 250 personer och 75 vitmålade bussar, lastbilar och ambulanser för att transportera fångarna till ett läger där det svenska Röda Korset väntade och skulle vårda dessa personer. Lägret låg i Neuengamme utanför Hamburg. Ytterligare förhandlingar ledde till att Bernadotte fick transportera dessa till Sverige.[11] Bernadotte lyckades även redan i februari 1945 utverka tillstånd att hemföra svenska kvinnor, som vunnit tyskt medborgarskap genom att gifta sig med tyska män. Under senare förhandlingar lyckades han ytterligare utverka rätt att föra ut även andra grupper. 24 april 1945 fick han av Himmler i uppdrag att framföra ett förslag till Västmakterna om att Tyskland skulle kapitulera för dem på Västfronten och i Danmark och Norge. Via svenska utrikesdepartementet framfördes förslaget för de allierade 26 april 1945 men det kom att avvisas.

Du har en vattendelare inom den konstruktiva kritiken
Schönbergs betydande bidrag med kompositioner inom den moderna konstmusiken sträcker sig över en period om över femtio år. Verken brukar delas in i tre perioder, trots att denna delning "fördunklar lika mycket som den förklarar", eftersom musiken i var och en av perioderna är synnerligen varierad. Tanken att hans tolvtonsperiod "representerar en stilistiskt enhetlig mängd verk stöds helt enkelt inte av musikaliska bevis"[16] och viktiga musikaliska karaktäristika – särskilt de som handlar om utveckling av motiven – överskrider tydligt gränserna mellan perioderna. Den första perioden, 1894–1907, brukar identifieras både genom arvet från senromantiken under slutet av 1800-talet och expressionistiska rörelser inom konsten och poesin. Den andra, 1908-1922, kännetecknas av att han övergett bestämda tonarter, en stil som ofta beskrivs (dock inte av Schönberg) som atonal eller fritonal. Den tredje, från 1923 och framåt, inleds med Schönbergs konstruktion av tolvtonstekniken. Schönbergs mest kända elever Hans Eisler, Alban Berg och Anton Webern följde honom troget genom vart och ett av dessa intellektuella och estetiska moment, om än inte utan avsevärd experimentlusta och variation i uttrycket.
hans elever fanns specifika allmänna utvecklingslagar, vilka därefter blir medvetet målinriktade
Efter andra världskriget fortsatte arbetarrörelsens splittring som ytterligare på grund av olika analyser av kapitalismens utveckling och olika inställning till klasskamp. I och med den antimonopolistiska strategin på 1970- och 80-talen, såg kommunisterna det som sin huvuduppgift att dra in breda samhällsgrupper i kampen, grupper som alla på olika sätt drabbades av det kapitalistiska systemet. Under det kalla kriget lyckades imperialismen att med eurokommunismen driva in en kil i den kommunistiska rörelsen. I några västeuropeiska länder distanserade sig under 1970-talet falanger inom det kommunistiska partiet från Sovjetunionen, bekände sig till den borgerliga parlamentarismen och strävade efter att komma i regeringsställning. I Sverige övergav SKP 1964 sin konsekvent socialistiska och internationalistiska linje, bytte 1967 namn till Vänsterpartiet Kommunisterna (VPK) och blev några decennier senare Vänsterpartiet.

Motsättningar mellan Sovjetunionen och Kina om den socialistiska vägen gagnade också imperialismens intressen. Flera smågrupper lösgjorde sig från det ideologiskt försvagade kommunistiska partiet. Partier som i dag kallar sig vänsterpartier har program som ligger nära reformismen. Trenden inom den europeiska vänstern att söka lösningar i en välfärdsstat av nordisk modell förbiser att den nyliberala kapitalismen inte längre är villig att ge samma reformutrymme som efter andra världskriget då socialismens världssystem utmanade kapitalismen.
De ledande industriländerna tog steget över till monopolkapitalismens statsmonopolistiska skede. Också i Sverige ökade den borgerliga statens intervention inom ekonomin. Det stod klart att det monopolkapitalistiska systemet krävde nya mekanismer för att mildra och reglera kriserna och samtidigt garantera monopolens profiter. Den socialdemokratiska delen av arbetarrörelsen vann regeringsställning och hade en stark position inom fackföreningsrörelsen. Det fanns en medveten vilja hos partiledningen att bygga upp former för samarbete mellan arbetarklassen och kapitalistklassen. Skapandet av Arbetsdomstolen 1928 och Saltsjöbadsavtalet 1938 är de främsta exemplen på detta klassamarbete. Socialdemokratin genomsyras samtidigt av antikommunism och vill ställa kommunisterna utanför arbetarrörelsen genom att hävda att denna enbart utgörs av socialdemokratins politiska och fackliga gren.

I valet 1932 vann SKP riksdagsmandat. I kampen mot klassamarbetet, för arbetarklassens dagskrav och för en revolutionär övergång till socialism i Sverige var det kommunistiska partiet den ledande kraften. Så går exempelvis dagens kostnadsfria skolbespisning tillbaka på ett SKP-initiativ från 1930-talet. Efter andra världskriget ledde en SKP-proposition om en statligt ägd industri för förädling av råvaror i Luleå till byggandet av Norrbottens Järnverk. Umeå Universitet grundades efter partiets förslag till riksdagen om att ett universitet ska etableras i övre Norrland.
I kampen för en enhetsfront mot fascismen, för stöd åt fascismens offer och internationell solidaritet spelade partiet en viktig roll. På så sätt bar det kommunistiska partiet under nya ekonomiska och politiska betingelser arvet från arbetarrörelsens barndom vidare genom att förena kampen för mänsklighetens överlevnad med den aktuella klasskampen.
Den relativt långa period av goda konjunkturer på grund av industriell utveckling men även militär rustning som föregick det första världskriget skapade motsättningar inom arbetarrörelsens partier – de socialdemokratiska partierna. Motsättningarna gällde nödvändigheten att hålla fast vid den marxistiska teorin. Enligt den kan kapitalismen inte reformeras bort utan måste berövas sin ekonomiska och politiska makt. Motsättningarna gällde också om huruvida parollen ”proletärer i alla länder, förena er”, det vill säga arbetarrörelsens internationella principer, skulle efterlevas eller inte. Dessa motsättningar kom till konkret uttryck när arbetarpartierna i de flesta länder beviljade krigskrediter i respektive parlament åt imperialistiska regeringar som hotade mänskligheten med ett världskrig. Kampen för freden och kampen mot den chauvinistiska och aggressiva nationalismen blev en vattendelare inom den europeiska arbetarrörelsen.

I och med första världskrigets utbrott och den socialistiska revolutionen i tsarryssland kunde inte längre den organisatoriska enheten inom de socialdemokratiska partierna upprätthållas. De delade sig i en höger- och en vänsterfalang. Den socialdemokratiska vänstern höll fast vid rörelsens socialistiska mål, internationella principer och konsekventa motstånd mot imperialismen och dess krig. Vänstern försvarade också den socialistiska revolutionen i Ryssland mot alla angrepp. I och med bildandet av Tredje Internationalen 1921 började dessa partier kalla sig kommunistiska
Hos arbetarklassen föddes under 1800-talets senare hälft, i striden för sina rättigheter, medvetenheten om att kampen måste föras samfällt och organiserat. Arbetarna började organisera sig i fackföreningar. I Sverige bildades Fackliga Landsorganisationen (LO) år 1889. Arbetare organiserade sig även i Nykterhetsrörelsen och något senare i Syndikalisterna (SAC). Samtidigt saknade arbetarklassen en klar insikt om det kapitalistiska samhällets lagbundenheter, hur en framgångsrik kamp skulle bedrivas och vilka mål den skulle sätta. Först när den anammade den vetenskapliga socialismen fick arbetarklassen det teoretiska vapen som krävdes för att ge kampen ett klart perspektiv. När arbetarklassens kamp förenades med den marxistiska teorin växte den socialistiska arbetarrörelsen fram och arbetarpartier bildades i Europa.
Schönberg började undervisa i kontrapunkt och komposition 1904. Hans första elever var Paul Pisk, Anton Webern, och Alban Berg där Webern och Berg skulle komma att bli de mest kända av hans många elever. Under sommaren 1908 övergav hans fru Mathilde honom under flera månader för den unge österrikiske målaren Richard Gerstl, som begick självmord när hon sedan lämnade honom för att återvända till sin make och sina barn. Denna händelse avspeglade sig tydligt i Schönbergs verk. Under hustruns frånvaro skrev han Du lehnest wider eine Silberweide, den trettonde sången i sångcykeln Das Buch der Hängenden Gärten, op. 15, som baseras på textsamlingen med samma namn av den mytomspunna tyska poeten Stefan George. Detta var Schönbergs första komposition helt utan förankring i en specifik tonart.[5] Under detta år fullbordade han också ett av sina mest revolutionerande verk, stråkkvartett nr. 2, vars första två satser visserligen är kromatiskt färgade men ändå har traditionella tonartsbeteckningar. De sista två satserna, som också har texter av Stefan George, däremot, löser på ett djärvt sätt upp kopplingen till traditionell tonalitet (även om båda satserna slutar med tonala ackord - och verket är inte alltigenom atonalt) och bryter mot stråkkvartettraditionen genom att de också innehåller en sångstämma för solosopran.
Schönberg var tidigt vida känd för att parallellt ha lyckats utveckla tankegods från både Brahms och Wagner, vilka tidigare ofta beskrivits som motsatta traditioner av den tyska romantiken. Senare blev han synonym med sina innovationer inom atonalitet som kom att bli en av de mest omdebatterade uttrycken inom 1900-talets konstmusik. På 1920-talet utvecklade Schönberg tolvtonstekniken, ett inflytelserikt formellt regelverk inom komposition för att skapa serier av de tolv tonerna i den kromatiska skalan. Han myntade också begreppet developing variation (ungefär: 'varierad genomföring') för en formalistisk teknik att skapa utifrån redan existerande material. Han var även den första moderna tonsättare att ta till sig tekniken att utveckla musikaliska motiv utan att använda ett dominerande centralt melodiskt tema.

Schönberg var också konstnär, en betydande musikteoretiker och en inflytelserik kompositionslärare. Bland hans elever fanns Alban Berg, Anton Webern, Viktor Ullmann, Eduard Hladisch, John Cage, Hanns Eisler, Josef Zmigrod, med flera. Många av Schönbergs övningar innebar en formalisering av kompositionsmetoden och han hade för vana att uppmana åhörarna till ett analytiskt tänkande, något som gav eko hos det musikaliska avantgardet under hela 1900-talet. Hans ofta polemiska tankar kring musikhistorien och estetiken var av avgörande betydelse för många av 1900-talets betydande musikvetare och musikkritiker, bland andra Theodor Adorno, Charles Rosen, och Carl Dahlhaus.
Marxismen är en levande lära som drar slutsatser utifrån en förändrad verklighet. Den erkänner inga absoluta sanningar eller högsta auktoriteter, utan allting befinner sig i förändring. Tänkare och revolutionära ledare har bidragit till den socialistiska skattkammaren och många fler kommer att göra det i framtiden. Förändrade styrkeförhållanden och en globaliserad produktion ställer de kommunistiska partierna inför nya uppgifter.
2001 strök den svenska socialdemokratin i sitt partiprogram formuleringen från 1944 att bestämmanderätten över produktionen och dess fördelning ska läggas i hela folkets händer. Men principen från 1944 hade i praktiken övergivits långt tidigare. Föreställningen att en ”demokratisk socialism” ska införas med hjälp av den borgerliga demokratin och utan ”socialisering”, det vill säga att föra över produktionsmedlen i samhällets händer, avslöjar en ovetenskaplig syn på demokrati som i varje samhälle har ett klassinnehåll. Det socialdemokratiska partiet är ett arbetarparti till sin medlemsbas men inte längre till sin ideologi och politik.
vilja skicka dig till handling – det historiska materialismen visade Lenin att upptäcka misstag, för partiets styrka är fel då ledande filosoferna Hegel och byar

utvecklingslagar, vilka därefter blir medvetet målinriktade
Genom en grundlig analys och kritik av såväl de utopiska socialisterna som verk av de då ledande filosoferna Hegel och Feuerbach, skapade Karl Marx och Friedrich Engels en ny filosofi på vetenskaplig grund. Denna filosofi, den dialektiska materialismen, ersatte de utopiska socialisternas humanism med att visa att det fanns specifika allmänna utvecklingslagar, vilka bevisade att människan och hennes idéer är en produkt av de rådande materiella betingelserna. Genom att utnyttja denna filosofis utvecklingslagar för att studera det kapitalistiska systemet lyckades man att blottlägga motsättningarna mellan produktionsförhållandena och produktivkrafterna och visa att denna motsättning leder till kriser samt klasskamp mellan borgarklass och arbetarklass. Den historiska materialismen visade också att klasskamp har existerat inom alla tidigare samhällen. Den har lett till att samhället revolutionärt omdanades och att den tidigare besuttna klassen gick under och ersattes av en ny klass samt att en ny stat skapades som skulle tjäna denna nya klass. Den vetenskapliga socialismen ledde också till insikt om att proletariatet har en historisk roll, att på sikt avskaffa klassamhället och bana väg för det kommunistiska samhället.

Efter Marx och Engels utvecklades den marxistiska teorin parallellt med arbetarrörelsens och kapitalismens utveckling i olika länder. Det främsta bidraget till marxismens utveckling i teori och praktik gavs av Lenin som stod i spetsen för den första framgångsrika socialistiska revolutionen i världen. Framför allt Lenins partiteori och hans analys av kapitalismens övergång från konkurrens- till monopolkapitalism, imperialismens epok, fick avgörande betydelse för den socialistiska arbetarrörelsens utveckling. I sin praktiska politik visade Lenin att vägen till framgång endast är möjlig om proletariatet kring sig förenar breda skikt utanför arbetarklassen.
Sveriges Kommunistiska Parti arbetar efter den demokratiska centralismens principer. En förutsättning för partiets styrka är att det kan agera enhetligt. En verklig levande enhet inom partiet kan endast grundas och utvecklas på demokratisk väg genom att olika meningar och förslag behandlas kollektivt, jämförs och diskuteras innan beslut fattas, vilka därefter blir bindande för alla partimedlemmar. Partiet granskar fortlöpande sin verksamhet både kritiskt och självkritiskt för att upptäcka misstag, för att lära av dessa och för att kunna förbättra arbetet. Detta arbetssätt är en garanti för att partiet är ett handlingskraftigt parti som kan leda arbetarklassen mot dess mål.

dén om ett samhälle utan utsugning har gått hand i hand med klassamhället men det var inte förrän kapitalismens inträde på 1700-talet som dessa idéer började få konkreta uttryck i form av socialistiska teorier. Teoretikerna som hade humanism, aktning för och omtanke om människan i centrum för sina socialistiska teorier kallas utopiska socialister. De utopiska socialisterna bidrog med att teckna ett idealsamhälle som frigjorde människans potential och omvandlade arbetet från ett tvång till ett livsbehov och en njutning. De insåg att för att nå idealsamhället krävdes det kapitalistiska systemet ersätts med ett nytt system som innebar egendomsgemenskap – det kommunistiska samhället. De mest medvetna insåg också att det var nödvändigt med en centraliserad och planmässig ekonomi där de olika samhällsprocesserna blir medvetet målinriktade.

Trots sitt betydande bidrag i kampen för ett bättre samhälle misslyckades de utopiska socialisterna med sina mål. Deras teorier byggde framför allt på upplysning och fostran och de såg inte arbetarklassen som verkställare av sina idéer vilket isolerade dem från massorna. Resultatet kunde heller inte ha blivit annorlunda med tanke på att de samhällshistoriska förhållandena de levde i var outvecklade, vilket gav upphov till omogna teorier. Det krävdes att produktivkrafterna frigjordes från den feodala spärren för att den vetenskapliga socialismen skulle kunna träda fram på scenen. Borgarklassen kom under 1800-talets första decennier att befästa sin ekonomiska och politiska makt. I sin jakt på profit fann denna klass det vara i sitt intresse att utveckla produktionen och utvidga den till hela världen. Denna process gav upphov till en ny klass, industriproletariatet. Detta proletariat, tillsammans med de förslavade folken i kolonierna, kom att leva under plågsamma villkor trots att de skapade rikedomar som aldrig tidigare.

Därför lägger Sveriges Kommunistiska Parti fram ett program för landets utveckling i riktning mot socialismen. Vi förklarar vilket slags samhälle vi har i Sverige i dag, vilka motsättningar som finns och vilken strategi vi väljer för att det arbetande folket ska kunna bygga sitt eget samhällssystem. Vid sidan om detta principprogram har partiet också andra program. I handlingsprogrammet beskriver vi vår syn på aktuella frågor. Så länge det finns förtryckare och förtryckta, så länge kapitalismen existerar, så länge miljön hotas och människor diskrimineras på grund av etnicitet och kön krävs kamp. Programmet kan läsas som en vägledning till handling – vår förväntan är att programmet ska inspirera dig till att aktivt ta del i klasskampen.

Sveriges Kommunistiska Parti (SKP) har djupa rötter i den svenska arbetarklassen. Partiet grundades 1917 ur det dåvarande socialdemokratiska parti som en följd av kampen mot revisionen av marxismen. Det växte fram i kampen för fred, arbete och bröd, för demokrati, proletär internationalism och socialism. På 1960- och 70-talen utvecklades partiet i opportunistisk riktning. Partiets ideologi åsidosattes för principlösa beslut och dess karaktär förändrades så att det inte längre uppfyllde kraven som ställs på ett kommunistiskt parti. Klassmedvetna medlemmar blev uteslutna eller lämnade partiet självmant och 1977 fattade dessa kamrater beslut om att återupprätta det kommunistiska partiet i Sverige under det provisoriska namnet Arbetarpartiet Kommunisterna – APK. Vid partiets 31:a kongress 1995 beslutades att återta namnet Sveriges Kommunistiska Parti. Partiet representerar kontinuiteten och det historiska arvet från Marx, Engels och Lenin inom den svenska arbetarrörelsen.

Sveriges Kommunistiska Parti är ett suveränt parti. Partiet utarbetar självständigt sin politiska linje, strategi och taktik. I sin kamp utgår partiet från förhållandena i Sverige och arbetarklassens bästa traditioner i vårt land. Samtidigt söker det att tillgodogöra sig erfarenheter från de kommunistiska partierna i andra länder. Sveriges Kommunistiska Parti är en del av den kommunistiska världsrörelsen och deltar på dess internationella möten och sammankomster. Partiet förenas med sina broderpartier på grundval av en gemensam teori, marxismen-leninismen och den proletära internationalismen, det vill säga principen om klassolidaritet och ömsesidigt stöd samt respekt för självständighet och likaberättigande mellan partierna.
I vårt eget land måste tryggheten på arbetsmarknaden stärkas kraftigt. För hundra år sedan stod man utanför fabriken med mössan i handen och undrade om det var just denna dag som arbetsköparen skulle låta en jobba. I dag sitter man hemma och väntar på ett sms i mobiltelefonen och undrar om det blir något jobb. Utvecklingen som tidigare delvis gått framåt går nu med raska steg bakåt. Kapitalismen kännetecknas också av att en mindre grupp av befolkningen, kapitalistklassen, blir allt rikare. Den klassen gör allt för att behålla sin ekonomiska och politiska makt i samhället, till exempel genom att äga nästan all media. Produktionen är beroende av insatser från det arbetande folket. Under kapitalismen går de vinster som skapas bara till viss del tillbaka till de arbetande och samhället. En stor och växande del behålls av kapitalisterna. De allt större vinster som de arbetande skapar borde rimligtvist användas till ökade löner, ökad välfärd, sänkt arbetstid och annat, men så är inte fallet. Kapitalismen strider mot allt förnuft och leder till kriser och nöd. Systemet måste ersättas av ett nytt. Arbetarklassen som har god utbildning och är fullt förtrogen med produktionsprocessen eller andra verksamhetsområden kan själv ta över ledningen och makten. Arbete och mat för dagen ska inte förbli en önskedröm i de fattiga delarna av världen.

Ojdå
På grund av miljoner människors dagliga arbete världen över skapas materiella och kulturella produkter i överflöd. Alla människor skulle kunna leva ett tryggt liv. Samtidigt som flertalet människor i Sverige och andra rika länder lever i materiellt välstånd lever flertalet av jordens befolkning i fattigdom och miljoner barn dör av svält. Militära rustningar slukar miljarder medan allt fler drabbas av sjukdomar till följd av fattigdom och nöd. ”Så här ska det vara, för så har det alltid varit”, säger de som har makt och privilegier. ”Det ligger också i människans natur att gynna sig själv och vara egoistisk” säger samma människor. Så här ska det inte få fortsätta att vara, säger vi. Människan är varken född god eller ond, givmild eller egoistisk. Det är samhället vi växer upp i som påverkar hur vi tänker och agerar. Därför måste samhället förändras i en riktning som utvecklar positiva egenskaper hos människor, gör dem solidariska och till varandras medspelare i stället för konkurrenter. Ingen ska utnyttja någon annans arbetskraft och välvilja för egen vinning.
Naturen måste bevaras från utplundring av resurser till fördel för mäktiga ekonomiska krafter. Miljökatastrofer med försurning av vatten och förorening av luften och jorden som följd är i dag ett faktum i många av världens städer och byar.

The Day–Stout–Warren (DSW) algorithm is a method for efficiently balancing binary search trees — that is, decreasing their height to O(log n) nodes, where n is the total number of nodes. Unlike a self-balancing binary search tree, it does not do this incrementally during each operation, but periodically, so that its cost can be amortized over many operations. The algorithm was designed by Quentin F. Stout and Bette Warren in a 1986 CACM paper,[1] based on work done by Colin Day in 1976.[2]

The algorithm requires linear (O(n)) time and is in-place. The original algorithm by Day generates as compact a tree as possible: all levels of the tree are completely full except possibly the bottom-most. It operates in two phases. First, the tree is turned into a linked list by means of an in-order traversal, reusing the pointers in the (threaded) tree's nodes. A series of left-rotations forms the second phase.[3] The Stout–Warren modification generates a complete binary tree, namely one in which the bottom-most level is filled strictly from left to right. This is a useful transformation to perform if it is known that no more inserts will be done. It does not require the tree to be threaded, nor does it require more than constant space to operate.[1] Like the original algorithm, Day–Stout–Warren operates in two phases, the first entirely new, the second a modification of Day's rotation phase.[1][3]

A 2002 article by Timothy J. Rolfe brought attention back to the DSW algorithm;[3] the naming is from the section title "6.7.1: The DSW Algorithm" in Adam Drozdek's textbook.[4] Rolfe cites two main advantages: "in circumstances in which one generates an entire binary search tree at the beginning of processing, followed by item look-up access for the rest of processing" and "pedagogically within a course on data structures where one progresses from the binary search tree into self-adjusting trees, since it gives a first exposure to doing rotations within a binary search tree."

I gotta say, at that time I'd like to meet Kanye
See, I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes
I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye
I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Kanye
What if Kanye made a song about Kanye
Called "I Miss The Old Kanye"? Man, that'd be so Kanye
That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye
And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye

"You'll Be Back" is a song from the Broadway musical Hamilton performed by Jonathan Groff (King George).

You say the price of my love's not a price that you're willing to pay
You cry in your tea which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by
Why so sad?
Remember we made an arrangement when you went away
Now you're making me mad
Remember despite our estrangement, I'm your man

You'll be back
Soon you'll see
You'll remember you belong to me
You'll be back
Time will tell
You'll remember that I served you well

Oceans rise, empires fall
We have seen each other through it all
And when push comes to shove,
I will send a fully armed battalion to remind you of my love

Da dada da da
Da dadada dayada
Dada da da dayada

Da dada da da
Da dadada dayada
Dada da da da

You say our love is draining and you can't go on
You'll be the one complaining when I am gone

And, no, don't change the subject
'Cause you're my favorite subject
My sweet, submissive subject
My loyal, royal subject
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever

You'll be back
Like before
I will fight the fight and win the war
For your love
For your praise
And I'll love you till my dying days

When you're gone, I'll go mad
So don't throw away this thing we had
'Cause when push comes to shove
I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love

Da dada da da
Da dadada dayada
Dada da da dayada

Everybody!

But 🍑🤔 I didn't 😘 do 👀👎 anything 🍆💰 to stop 👋🛑 the bullies, 🖕👌 and 💰 it 💦 got worse. Much ✋ worse. In my 👁 freshman year 🌅🎉 of 👏 high school, 🙃 I 👀👁 emailed the 🏳 principal my 👇 suicide letter. 💇 I 😈😫 asked ⬇🙋 her 💦 to 💦 tell 🗣 my old 👵 "friends" 👫 that this 😎💦 was 😏 their fault. ✌

He 📈 glanced around, noticing the framed photographs such as some old 👵 man's 🌊😍 feet and 👉 a 👌 lotion-soaked model's 👁 feet. 👣 His smile, ⭐ that which 🙌👏 I 🅱👁 had 👟👉 missed 😢😢 for so 💒 long, 😩🕑 that I 😻 longed to 👋 see again, 👑 faded. Slowly, ❌😳 Rowley turned back 🙄😻 to 👉♂ me, 🏻😞 his massive 😯 gut rumbling and ➕ his dirty 💩 red 🔴 beard trembling. 🤕 His 🙏🤓 glass 🍷🍷 eye 👁👀 was rolling in 👏 his head, 🤕 his 👃♂ nostril hair 💈💈 quivering 😧 in 🔙🏡 what seemed 💌💌 to be 🤔💀 fear.
I 💭 asked ⬇🏻 him what 😱 was wrong, and I 👀👧 watched one drop of saliva fall 🍂 from his 💦 gaping mouth. 🙊 He 😎 yelled, 🗣 "WHAT THE FUCK, ⚰🍆 MAN?!? 👎👨 A FOOT 👣👟 FETISH? 😏😏 REALLY?!?" and 👏 ran ♂ away 🙅♂ from my 💳👨 house, 🐕🛅 never to 💯👌 see 👀👌 me 😂💦 again.
The worst 🦃👹 part 🤔 of 💦💦 it 😉 is 👉💡 that 🕵 I didn't call out to him, 🔥 I 👁👦 didn't 😑😘 try to 🤔🤧 stop 🚫 him 😀 from leaving.

En del som kallar sig feminister ser en parallell mellan förbudet mot surrogatmödraskap och rätten till abort. Vi motsätter oss denna parallell. För det första så kränker alltid surrogatmödraskap kvinnans kroppsliga integritet eftersom hela upplägget från början går ut på att ”använda” kvinnans kropp på ett sätt som är frånkopplat kvinnans egna behov och känslor. En oönskad graviditet i sig innebär oftast inte att kvinnan utsatts för någon kränkning. Mannens påtryckningar, oansvarighet eller hot innebär förstås kränkningar, men själva graviditeten utgör då inte en kränkning (med undantag för våldtäkt och incest).

För det andra, och viktigare, är att en abort alltid innebär att en annan människas liv tas, vilket väger tyngre än kvinnans kroppsliga integritet. Även om vi motsätter oss surrogatmödraskap skulle vi alltså aldrig förorda att en surrogatmoder har rätt att göra abort, eftersom man då kränker någon annans kropp (fostrets) på ett långt grövre sätt än den kränkning surrogatmödraskapet innebär.
ur kvinnan och innebär dessutom ett officiellt ställningstagande strider inte är principiellt felaktigt och överlåtelse till grund för ofödda barn för att dra i och barn har ett kommunens samarbete med hennes kön, ålder, sociala status, etnicitet, hudfärg, intelligens, beroendegrad, medvetandegrad, handikapp, politiska beslut som försöker rasera vad det möjligt för pojkar respektive kvinnlig
Men varför inte tillåta altruistisk surrogatmödraskap? För det första tror vi att gränsen mellan altruistiskt och kommersiellt surrogatmödraskap är svår att dra i praktiken. Även den som osjälviskt vill ställa upp och bära ett barn för någon annans skull bör få viss ekonomisk ersättning på grund av kostnader och inkomstbortfall kopplade till graviditeten. Men så fort pengar kommer in i bilden är det lätt att man ger lite extra pengar som ett tack. Och om det inte är fel, varför är det då fel med ett ”stort tack”, dvs en rejäl summa pengar?

För det andra kommer toleransen gentemot kommersiellt surrogatmödraskap sannolikt öka om man tillåter altruistiskt surrogatmödraskap. Grundfrågan är om det är moraliskt godtagbart att en kvinna avsäger sig ”rätten till sin kropp” på detta sätt, vare sig det sker av välvilja eller för pengar. Vi menar att surrogatmödraskap i sig kränker kvinnans kroppsliga integritet och därför inte ska tillåtas.
upplevelse av ett handikapp som genomgått en annan människa börjar framträda
Bru
De främsta argumenten mot kommersiellt surrogatmödraskap är att det kränker både surrogatmamman och det barn hon bär. Kvinnan kränks då man köper sig rätten att utnyttja en hennes kropp och reproduktiva förmåga. Detta är en allt för intim och privat del av kvinnans kropp och psyke för att vara föremål för ekonomiska transaktioner. Häri ligger en legitim likhet med prostitution. Vi är övertygade om att det sätter djupa spår i en kvinna när hon redan frånbörjan går med på att vara gravid i nio månader i akt och mening att lämna ifrån sig barnet. Och skulle det inte sätta djupa påtagliga spår så beror det på att kvinnan lyckas med att inte knyta an till det barn hon bär, vilket är fullkomligt bakvänt både psykologiskt och biologiskt, och inget som ska uppmuntras.

Kommersiellt surrogatmödraskap innebär också en kränkning av barnet då det i praktiken blir människohandel. Man köper ju ett barn. Att så är fallet kan lätt ses när man ställer följande fråga: ”Skulle det beställande paret betala lika mycket till surrogatmamman om fostret dör i och med förlossningen?” En viss del av pengarna går förvisso till omkostnader och till ”hyra av livmoder”, men en del går också till själva ”produkten” dvs barnet. Detta innebär ett förtingligande av en människa vilket är moraliskt förkastligt. Surrogatmödraskap cementerar en kränkande människo- och kvinnosyn, och riskerar att indirekt bidra till andra övergrepp mot kvinnor och barn.
Bru
Surrogatmödraskap innebär att en kvinna görs gravid i syfte att direkt vid födseln adoptera bort barnet. Partiellt surrogamödraskap innebär att surrogatmammans ägg befruktats genom insemination. Fullständigt surrogatmödraskap innebär att ett befruktat ägg från en annan kvinna förs in i den blivande surrogatmodern. Man skiljer också mellan kommersiellt och altruistiskt surrogatmödraskap. Det förra innebär att surrogatmoderns främsta motiv är att få pengar för att hon bär fram barnet. Det senare innebär att ingen, eller endast en blygsam ersättning ges, och där det främsta motivet är altruistiskt. Då ställer surrogatmodern upp i första hand för det barnlösa parets skull.

Kristna Värdepartiet stöder Sveriges nuvarande lagstiftning som förbjuder surrogatmödraskap. Kommersiellt surrogatmödraskap är en mångmiljardindustri där i första hand kvinnor från fattiga länder görs gravida för att föda barn åt rikare västerlänningar. Vi menar att detta är att utnyttja dessa kvinnors utsatthet och innebär att man exploaterar fattiga kvinnors kroppar. Sverige bör finna sätt att aktivt motverka denna industri.
Provrörsbefruktning innebär att ett större antal ägg tas ut ur kvinnan och sedan befruktas i ett ”provrör”. Av dessa väljs ett ägg ut som förs in i kvinnans livmoder. Övriga befruktade ägg av god kvalitet kan frysas in i max fem år för att användas till ett senare försök att göra kvinnan gravid. Är kvaliteten dålig kasseras äggen. Ägg som varit infrysta i mer än fem år kasseras också. Vissa befruktade ägg kan också användas till forskning om kvinnan ger tillstånd till det. Kristna Värdepartiet utgår från att varje människa börjar existera i och med befruktningen. Befruktade ägg är alltså små helt outvecklade människor och bör respekteras som sådana. Därför är den nuvarande hanteringen av befruktade mänskliga ägg oacceptabel. Vi menar att varje befruktat ägg endast får befruktas om intentionen är att implantera ägget i en kvinnas livmoder. Utöver det ska mänskliga ägg inte få befruktas. Provrörsbefruktning ska alltså endast få ske utifrån mottot ”ge varje embryo en chans”. Vi vänder också kraftfullt mot att forskning bedrivs på dessa små outvecklade människor. Ett mänskligt befruktat ägg måste behandlas utifrån vad det är, nämligen en liten nybliven människa.

I dag används fosterdiagnostik i huvudsak för att sortera ut foster med vissa skador eller kromosomavvikelser. Vi vänder oss kraftfullt mot denna ovärdiga utsortering av människor. Vi menar att fosterdiagnostik aldrig får användas i detta syfte, utan endast när det inte leder till skada för vare sig mamman eller hennes ofödda barn. Flera metoder för fosterdiagnostisk bör omedelbart förbjudas, exempelvis fostervattenprov som medför en missfallsrisk på 1%, och moderkaksprov som medför en missfallsrisk på 1–2%. KUB-testet, är en screening för att hitta foster med Downs syndrom, bör också förbjudas då det inte finns något medicinskt gagn för det ofödda barnet. Så länge vi har en liberal abortlagstiftning vill Kristna Värdepartiet verka för att fosterdiagnostikens utsorterande effekter blir så små som möjligt. Därför kräver vi som ett första steg att blivande föräldrar aldrig ska kunna få ut information om barnets kön eller andra medicinskt oviktiga egenskaper. Sådan information kan endast tillåtas ges efter den tidpunkt då abort inte längre får utföras. Det läggs stora mängder pengar på att upptäcka Downs och andra genetiska syndrom/sjukdomar hos ofödda barn. Dessa pengar bör istället läggas på forskning till förmån för människor med Downs syndrom och andra syndrom/sjukdomar för vilka man idag gör utsorterande fosterdiagnostik.

Bioetik är den del av etiken som handlar om livets början och livets slut inom sjukvården. Inom bioetiken diskuteras etiska frågor om abort, fosterdiagnostik, reproduktiva teknologier, embryoforskning, organdonation och dödshjälp. Abort och dödshjälp har egna avsnitt i partiprogrammet och här behandlas Kristna Värdepartiets syn på de övriga bioetiska frågorna. För oss är en grundläggande etisk princip att varje människa ska tillerkännas fullt människovärde, allt ifrån befruktningen till en naturlig död. Rätten till liv är den mest grundläggande av alla. Denna princip måste vara vägledande för alla politiska beslut som rör bioetik.

Studier har visat att denna oro inte är hypotetisk. I exempelvis Nederländerna är dödshjälp tillåtet och omgärdat med strikta riktlinjer som säger att dödshjälp endast får ges om patienten uttryckligen vill det och endast som ”sista utväg”, dvs. om effektiv smärtlindring och palliativ vård inte anses fungera tillfredsställande. Trots detta har studier visat att tillämpningen av dödshjälp i Nederländerna hamnat på ett sluttande plan. Exempelvis saknas patientens uttryckliga vilja att dö i 20% av dödshjälpsfallen. Även spädbarn har dödats, och fallen där läkare undanhåller medicinska åtgärder i syfte att förkorta patientens liv tycks ha ökat. Stora brister i läkarnas rapportering har också upptäckts.(1) En annan illustration av det sluttande planet är Belgien som 2002 tillät dödshjälp. 2014 utvidgades lagen och som första land i världen tillåter Belgien nu dödshjälp för barn, utan några åldersrestriktioner(2) .

Risken är också stor att införandet av dödshjälp sannolikt skulle påverka samhällets syn på funktionshindrade och svårt sjuka människor.  (3) När människor genom olyckor och sjukdomar blir funktionsnedsatta är det mycket sannolikt att flera av dessa vill ha dödshjälp istället för att gå igenom den svåra anpassningsperiod som det innebär att lära sig leva med sin funktionsnedsättning. Dessa behöver inte dödshjälp utan livshjälp. Stödet till dessa, och även till personer med medfödda funktionshinder, riskerar att försvagas avsevärt om samhället tillåter dödshjälp.
Vi befarar också att samhällets motivation att förhindra självmord i allmänhet försvagas ytterligare om dödshjälp blir lagligt.

Dödshjälp
Rätten till liv kan ingen avsäga sig. Man kan avsäga sig rätten till ett ting genom att sälja det eller ge bort det. Men själva rätten att överhuvudtaget äga något – själva äganderätten i sig – är en rättighet ingen kan avsäga sig. Den har man i kraft av sin mänsklighet. På samma sätt är rätten till liv omöjlig att avsäga sig då den är grunden för alla andra rättigheter. Av detta skäl menar vi att dödshjälp och läkarassisterat självmord är principiellt felaktigt och därför aldrig bör tillåtas i lag.

Vidare accepterar inte ens dödshjälpsförespråkare att en vilja att dö är tillräcklig för att man ska få rättigheten att dö. En deprimerad tonåring som i övrigt är frisk kan under flera år önska sig döden men vara psykologiskt oförmögen att ta sitt liv. Ingen läkare skulle hjälpa en sådan tonåring att dö. Dödshjälpsförespråkare pekar alltid på ytterligare kriterier som är nödvändiga för att någon ska ha ”rätten” att bli dödad, exempelvis att personen har en kronisk smärta eller ett handikapp som gör att livet ”inte är värt att leva”. Här uppstår svåra gränsdragningsproblem. Vilken grad av smärta, vilka kroniska sjukdomar och vilka handikapp är tillräckligt allvarliga för att personens önskan att dö ska tillgodoses? Och vem ska bestämma dessa kriterier? Denna notoriskt svåra gränsdragningsproblematik ligger till grund för en svår rättsosäkerhet som visar sig på en rad olika sätt.

Kristna Värdepartiet menar att rätten till liv är en grundläggande mänsklig rättighet. Livet bör skyddas från befruktningen till en naturlig död. I ett civiliserat samhälle bör den medmänniska som överväger att avsluta sitt liv få bästa möjliga stöd för att fortsätta leva. Kristna Värdepartiet tar avstånd från dödshjälp och vill verka för en nollvision för självmord i Sverige.
Aktiv dödshjälp innebär dessutom ett systemskifte för hela den svenska lagstiftningen och dess tillämpning i vården, eftersom den skulle innebära att man tillåter avsiktligt dödande. Detta skulle leda till en mycket obehaglig mentalitetsförändring som i sin tur skulle skapa diskussioner, frågor och tankar vi inte vill ha i ett rättssäkert samhälle. Vårdpersonal skulle med stor sannolikhet fråga sig om det inte vore bättre för en viss patient – eller för samhället eller de anhöriga – om patienten ifråga dödades. Anhöriga skulle riskera att ständigt leva med en oro för att en sjuk anhörig skulle begära att få dödshjälp eller kanske även bli dödad mot sin vilja. Patienter skulle, både inför sig själva och anhöriga samt vårdpersonal tvingas motivera varför de borde få leva vidare.

I utredningen ”Jämställdhet i förskolan” står det att ”förskolan av den svenska modellen representerar såväl ett barnpedagogiskt som ett könspolitiskt projekt” och ”förskolans uppdrag att motverka traditionella könsroller och könsmönster handlar till stor del om att rasera gamla föreställningar om vad som är normalt beteende för pojkar respektive flickor.”4

Dagens undervisning i sex- och samlevnad på grundskola och gymnasieskola står under kraftfull påverkan av organisationer som RFSU och RFSL. Det förekommer undervisning som uppmuntrar till polyamorösa relationer, oralsex och pornografi. Denna identitetsupplösande pedagogik i förskolan och sexualiserade pedagogik i grund- och gymnasieskola tar vi i Kristna Värdepartiet kraftfullt avstånd från. Vi är övertygade om att barn ska få utveckla sin könsidentitet utan förskolepersonal som försöker rasera vad som är normalt beteende för pojkar och flickor. Förskolans uppgift får aldrig vara att i enlighet med queerteorin luckra upp barnens könsidentitet.

Skolans samlevnadsundervisning ska präglas av ett fokus på relationsetik som håller samman sexualitet och kärlek. Undervisning om sexuella handlingar och tekniker har ingen plats i skolans värld överhuvudtaget.
“Jag skall icke ge någon gift, om man ber mig därom, ej heller råda någon till dylikt …”

Kristna Värdepartiet vill

✓ att människovärdestanken formulerade i FN:s mänskliga rättigheter och barnkonventionen ska vara vägledande för alla politiska beslut

✓ att ”könskorrigerande” behandling i form av hormonbehandling och operation upphör inom den offentliga vården

✓ att ”könskorrigerande” behandling inte ska betalas med skattepengar

✓ att ”könskorrigerande” behandling ska inkludera sterilisering

✓ att privata kliniker som utför ”könskorrigerande” behandling åläggs att informera om riskerna med operationen

✓ att privata kliniker inte får utföra ”könskorrigerande” behandling på personer som har barn under 18 år

✓ att den nuvarande könspolitiska pedagogiken i förskolan slopas

✓ att den sexualiserade undervisningen i grund- och gymnasieskolan upphör

Uppskattningsvis ändrar sig en av fem som genomgått ”könskorrigerande” operationer och vill återgå till sitt ursprungliga kön.2 Studier indikerar också att de som genomgått en sådan operation inte blir fria från de psykologiska problem de hade innanoperationen. Exempelvis är självmord 20 gånger vanligare hos de som har genomgått en sådan operation jämfört med den övriga befolkningen. Av detta skäl finns det sjukhus som upphört med sådana operationer.3

Av dessa skäl menar vi att ”könskorrigerande” operationer inte ska betalas med skattemedel, och inte heller ska få utföras inom den offentliga vården. Däremot ska den offentliga vården erbjuda psykiatrisk hjälp till de som har denna typ av identitetsproblematik.
I grunden menar vi att könsbyte är en illusion eftersom varje cell fortfarande tillhör det ena eller andra könet rent genetiskt. Verklig könskorrigering är alltså inte möjligt. Vi menar att psykologiska problem som rör könsidentitet kan jämföras med Body Identity Disorder, där man vill få en viss fungerande kroppsdel amputerad, eller med en artidentitets-störning där man tror sig vara ett djur. Lösningen på dessa problem måste i första hand sökas inom psykiatrin.

Då en ”könskorrigerande” behandling utgör ett förnekande av det biologiska kön personen fötts med, och då detta biologiska kön är en förutsättning för fortplantning, menar vi att sterilisering måste vara en del av den ”könskorrigerande” behandlingen. Vår främsta motivering till detta är att varje barn har rätten att få bli till av föräldrar som bejakar den könsidentitet som är grunden för barnets tillkomst. Vi är dessutom övertygade om att barnets psykologiska utveckling främjas bäst av föräldrar som bejakar sitt biologiska kön. Enkelt uttryckt: varje barn har rätt till, och behöver en mamma och en pappa. En lagstiftning eller policy som frångår detta perspektiv är inte acceptabel.
Samhället ska inte understödja några andra samlevnadsformer än det tvåkönade äktenskapet. Samtidigt råder det avtalsfrihet, vilket möjliggör det juridiska reglerandet av andra sorters relationer. Vi vill alltså inte förbjuda homosexuella relationer.

Den kanske svåraste identitetsproblematiken gäller ofta transpersoner. Man upplever en djup kluvenhet i sin könsidentitet som inte sällan leder till djup depression, svår ångest och självmordsförsök. Detta är en grupp människor som gör oss kluvna utifrån våra kristna värderingar. Barmhärtigheten kräver att vi ser individens smärta och försöker hitta möjliga lösningar. Samtidigt tror vi att det finns en djup trasighet hos oss människor, och den trasigheten kan inte tillåtas definiera vad som är rätt eller fel.

I grunden är frågan om könstillhörighet en biologisk fråga som vanligtvis går att besvara på ett objektivt sätt. Hos en man och kvinna är varje cell manlig respektive kvinnlig. En individs subjektiva upplevelse av könstillhörighet kan inte få samhället att blunda för detta. Vi menar vidare att en persons könsidentitet inte enbart är den personens ensak. Ingen kan juridiskt tillåtas definiera sig hur som helst. Varje individ finns i ett samspel med andra, inte minst som egen familj. I detta sammanhang ser vi barnen som de mest sårbara. Vi tror att det är djupt skadligt för ett barn att uppleva hur en mamma eller pappa byter könsidentitet. Därför menar vi att ”könskorrigerande” behandlingar inte ska få tillåtas för den som har barn under 18 år.
En grundläggande aspekt av den mänskliga identiteten är en individs kön. Mänskligheten består av män och kvinnor. Några andra kön existerar inte 1 . Det är den biologiska föreningen av manligt och kvinnligt som leder till att barn blir till, och den psykologiska komplementariteten mellan manligt och kvinnligt ingår i de bästa förutsättningarna för barnens uppväxt. Därför tror vi att den tvåkönade familjen är den naturliga byggsten som varje välfungerande samhälle vilar på (se vidare våra avsnitt om äktenskap och familj).

Men det finns människor i vårt samhälle som inte känner att de passar in i denna ”heteronorm”. Många homosexuella, bisexuella, trans- och queerpersoner har kritiserat tanken på den tvåkönade kärnfamiljen som norm. Kritiken handlar om att man finner denna norm förtryckande på olika sätt. Vi har respekt för den problematik individer kan uppleva i relation till heteronormen. Samtidigt tror vi att vårt samhälle bör bejaka den grundläggande biologiska verkligheten att nytt liv blir till genom sammansmältningen av manligt och kvinnligt. Att erkänna detta och bygga vårt samhälle på detta faktum kan aldrig i sig vara förtryckande. Därför vill vi att staten intar en positiv hållning till det monogama, tvåkönade äktenskapet.
Utifrån detta vill vi:

Verka för att en utredning om psykologiska tvångsaborter tillsätts.
Verka för sjukvårdspersonalens självklara rätt att avstå från abortverksamheten av samvetsskäl.
Verka för en sexualundervisning i skolan som fokuserar på den relationella och känslomässiga aspekten av sexualiteten.
Verka för ett system som gör det möjligt för gravida kvinnor, ensamstående föräldrar och småbarnsfamiljer att klara sig ekonomiskt.
Verka för obligatorisk undervisning i grundskolan om fosterutvecklingen.
Verka för att olika restriktioner i abortlagen införs allt eftersom det finns politiskt utrymme för det, exempelvis (1) en successiv sänkning av abortgränsen, (2) ett slut på skattefinansierade aborter (3) obligatoriska kuratorssamtal, (4) obligatorisk betänketid, (5) förbud mot att minderåriga gör abort utan föräldrars kännedom.
staten intar en av föräldrar och kvinnligt som genomgått en ny unik och trohet och ersätts av manligt och inte känner att det finns det tvåkönade äktenskapet är att det är överlägsen andra könet rent genetiskt
Kristna Värdepartiet utgår från den kristna människosynen som betraktar människan som Guds avbild. Det innebär att människan har ett värde och en värdighet enbart i kraft av sin mänsklighet. En människas värde avgörs därför inte av egenskaper som har att göra med hennes kön, ålder, sociala status, etnicitet, hudfärg, intelligens, beroendegrad, medvetandegrad, handikapp, politiska åsikter, religiösa tro eller livsstilsval. Till detta människovärde finns flera viktiga rättigheter kopplade som bland annat formulerats av FN. Kristna Värdepartiet vill forma en politik som utgår från människovärdesprincipen och tillämpa den så konsekvent och tydligt vi någonsin kan.
Vi vill opinionsbilda utifrån en långsiktig vision av ett framtida samhälle där antalet aborter hålls på en minimal nivå och där kulturen genomsyras av en livsbejakande attityd till graviditet och oföddas mänsklighet. Denna kultur befästs och bevaras genom ett tydligt lagskydd för ofödda människor.
everything, always wearing tight business outfit skirts and I woulds’t use it while slaves were at least fondling eachothers test producers
värde enbart i kraft av människosläktets egenskaper företräds
I biologisk mening uppstår mänskligt liv i och med befruktningen. Befruktningen utgör starten på en ny unik individ, tillhörande det mänskliga släktet. Denna lilla människa börjar sitt liv som encellig individ men i sin rätta miljö utvecklas hon i snabb takt och redan efter ca tre veckor slår ett litet hjärta och huvud, armar och ben börjar framträda.

Påståendet att befruktningen innebär att en ny människa bildas är vetenskapligt, inte religiöst. En människa har ett grundläggande värde enbart i kraft av att hon är människa. Detta är en allmänt accepterad moralisk princip som ofta kallas människovärdesprincipen. FN:s mänskliga rättigheter bygger på denna princip. Därför menar vi att det ofödda människolivet ska tillerkännas grundläggande rättigheter, varav rätten till liv är den mest grundläggande. Vi vill följaktligen verka för att det ofödda människolivet ska skyddas med lag alltifrån befruktningen. Detta krav sätter vi in i en större helhetsbild som vi kallar för vår livsbejakande politik, med tre aspekter: (1) Långsiktighet och opinionsbildning,(2) generöst stöd och (3) en restriktiv abortlag.
Utifrån ovanstående vill vi verka enligt dessa punkter:

Att lagen om samkönade äktenskap rivs upp och ersätts av en traditionell lagstiftning.
Att sambolagen, partnerskapslagen och all typ av lagstiftning på området som inte är konsekvent avskaffas. Avtalsfrihet räcker för alla som inte vill ingå äktenskap.
Att alla vigselförrättare i väntan på en lagändring ska äga rätten att avstå samkönade vigslar
Att äktenskapsrådgivning, i ett kommunens samarbete med trossamfund och ideella organisationer, ska subventioneras och göras lättillgänglig
Att skolans samlevnadsundervisning ska lyfta fram äktenskapet mellan man och kvinna och främja värdena trohet, kyskhet och ansvarstagande.
Att gifta par ska sambeskattas i enlighet med familjeprincipen (1).
Alla som har uppnått en viss ålder, kan välja att gifta sig men en annan människa så länge denne är myndig, samtycker, är av motsatt kön och inte är en nära släkting. Eftersom äktenskapet är en grundsten i samhället ska lagstiftningen vara ut-formad så att den på alla sätt befrämjar äktenskapet. Lagstiftningen ska inte göra det ekonomiskt svårare för hushåll med gifta par än för andra relationer. Vi kräver att äktenskapsbalken ändras så att gifta par inte längre diskrimineras ekonomiskt. Familjer måste också få mer resurser så att föräldrar kan vara hemma längre med små barn, och därför vill vi införa familjeprincipen.
like a scholar
Det finns åtskilligt som gör äktenskapet unikt. Makarnas trohet och överlåtelse till varandra är grunden. Den förenande kärlek, som den sexuella gemenskapen utgör, är en viktig del av detta. Att den under normala omständigheter kan ge upphov till en ny unik medlem i den mänskliga familjen är förstås extra värdefullt. Äktenskapet är den enda parrelationen, där manligt och kvinnligt kan komplettera varandra så att hela fullheten av människosläktets egenskaper företräds. Vi önskar att varje barn skulle vara en frukt av kärleken mellan två personer som är helt överlåtna till varandra. Äktenskapet är den samlevnadsform som bäst bekräftar detta förhållande. Denna traditionella familjebildning har genomsyrat hela den mänskliga civilisationen på ett eller annat sätt. Om den inte är överlägsen andra samlevnadsformer, varför är den då så utspridd och dominerande både geografiskt och historiskt genom hela den mänskliga civilisationens historia?
Vi ser hela mänskligheten som en enda stor familj där vi alla delar en unik mänsklig gemenskap med moraliska skyldigheter gentemot varandra. Samtidigt finns det en viktig prioritering i våra mellanmänskliga relationer. Du har i första hand moraliska skyldigheter gentemot dina barn och din livskamrat. Kristna Värdepartiet ser äktenskapet som en unik och värdefull relation mellan man och kvinna. Äktenskapet är det synliga förbund som illustrerar kärleken mellan man och kvinna och är ett officiellt ställningstagande att dessa bildar en självständig familj.
Äktenskapet definieras som ett förbund där makarna avlägger löfte om en livslång överlåtelse och trohet mot varandra. Kristna Värdepartiet anser att äktenskapet är ett förbund mellan en man och en kvinna. Äktenskap kan inte vara sam-könade eller polygama. Detta ställningstagande strider inte mot idén om allas lika värde och innebär således inte någon diskriminering mot homosexuella eller andra grupper. Det finns ingen mänsklig rättighet att omdefiniera äktenskapet efter eget godtycke. Däremot har vi avtalsfrihet, dvs. två eller fler parter kan frivilligt ingå avtal som reglerar fördelning av ägodelar.

There would have been nothin' left to do for someone less astute
He woulda been dead or destitute without a cent of restitution
Started workin', clerkin' for his late mother’s landlord
Tradin' sugar cane and rum and all the things he can’t afford
Scammin' for every book he can get his hands on

In squalor, grow up to be a hero and a scholar?
The ten-dollar founding father without a father
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter By being a self-starter
By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a trading charter
And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted away
Across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter
Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain
Well, the word got around, they said, this kid is insane, man
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
Get your education, don’t forget from whence you came 
And the world is gonna know your name

I work in an office and my boss is this sexy ass milf in her 30's with dat ass dat everything, always wearing tight business outfit skirts and pants showing off her sweet angus and tight body, i probably jack off to the thought of her atleast 5 times a week. Well lately weve been renovating the office and things are pretty tight in there to move around it kinda like a maze or some shiit. Well today im going out on break and theres these 2 desks beside eachother and theres barely any room for 2 people to walk by in and wut do i see, my boss walking towards me.

I try to act cool but my face becomes flushed and it doesnt help that her tits are bouncing up and down as she walks, we get to the point of the desks at the same time and we kinda awkwardly try to walk by each other. We kinda get stuck a bit by the desks and shes facing away from me and her ass is right on my crotch, the second i feel this im in pure ecstasy and acquire a semi instantly. Her big juicy angus and me are now stuck and were trying to squeeze by each other and slowly moving through but her ass is grinding right up on me, i know i am about to cum and i tell her to move faster for the love of god, shes like wtf but i cannot stop at this point.

I blow the biggest load this month so far and i get transported to another dimension, my fat load starts to leak through my pants and onto her skirt, shes turns her head and see this and says omg are u serious. We finally seperate and i fall to my knees and begin to speak in tongues, waves of more orgasms flood over me, i crap my pants and begin to cry. I was immediately fired but i feel like a new man now and will masturbate to this memory forever.

save one😤😬 Catch me more
are there people who actually thinking sucking dick is gay?

you're sharing protein

you're admiring masculine physique

being in the vacinity of other high testosterone males increases your own testosterone

eating pussy is gay because you're litterally slurping down estrogen. and long term relationships have been proven to lower testosterone.

spartans had gay orgies all the time and they were the height of masculinity. you bet they were at least fondling eachothers test producers.

all these summer DYEL's piss me off. their twink bodies don't understand, but in time i'm sure they'll get it.

Jerry Seinfeld ended his show for retirement altogether, but that bees have never really cared
hello
bru
ok im talking now
It’s been nearly a decade since Jerry Seinfeld ended his era-defining namesake show. Since then we’ve barely seen him, apart from the odd commercial, YouTube short or documentary on stand-up (if you have region 1 DVD). Many mistook the public ‘retiring’ of his show for retirement altogether, but the comic did still want to work. Never a fan of his own acting, Seinfeld wanted to a) perform new material, and b) not do it in front of a camera. The answer became obvious, and here we are, with a new animated effort from Dreamworks.

2. himilco and the sea monsters of britain,
I know I’m not the first to tout praise’s benefits. And I’m willing to guess that most people recognize that praise is invaluable. The problem in most of our businesses, schools and relationships isn’t just that we fail to praise enough; it’s that we have been praising the wrong way. I would go so far as to say that our current model of praise demotivates our teams, exacerbates internal strife in our families, and places a cap on our potential.¨
Wisely, we open on a nice piece of natural absurdity. A narrator points out that bees shouldn’t, by any human understanding of aerodynamics or logic, be able to fly, but that bees have never really cared. So we’re happily launched into Barry the Bee’s colourful, impossibility-free life, in a hive full of rollercoaster roads and colourful, vaguely Jetson-like homes. From there, it should be easy.
Bee ventures outside, bee meets girl (human). So far, so good. Bee discovers humans are harvesting honey from bee farms. Bee decides to sue. Cue courtroom drama, visions of slavery and upsetting the delicate balance of the ecosystem among the usual guest voices and pop covers of old songs. A strange brew indeed…

I know I’m not the first to tout praise’s benefits. And I’m willing to guess that most people recognize that praise is invaluable. The problem in most of our businesses, schools and relationships isn’t just that we fail to praise enough; it’s that we have been praising the wrong way. I would go so far as to say that our current model of praise demotivates our teams, exacerbates internal strife in our families, and places a cap on our potential.
It’s been nearly a decade since Jerry Seinfeld ended his era-defining namesake show. Since then we’ve barely seen him, apart from the odd commercial, YouTube short or documentary on stand-up (if you have region 1 DVD). Many mistook the public ‘retiring’ of his show for retirement altogether, but the comic did still want to work. Never a fan of his own acting, Seinfeld wanted to a) perform new material, and b) not do it in front of a camera. The answer became obvious, and here we are, with a new animated effort from Dreamworks.
Yet what these people fail to recognize is that praise is actually a renewable resource. Praise creates what I call a virtuous cycle — the more you give, the more you enhance your own supply. When done right, praise primes the brain for higher performance, which means that the more we praise, the more success we create. And the more successes there are, the more there is to praise. The research I’ve been doing over the past five years shows that the more you can authentically shine praise on everyone in your ecosystem, the more your potential, individually and collectively, rises.

The worst piece of praise I’ve sometimes received after a talk is “You were the best speaker today.” What’s so bad about that? First of all, it undercuts all the other speakers. Moreover, it reminds me of the fact that in many other cases I won’t be the best speaker, so now I feel nervous and self-conscious. Instead of enhancing me, this comment unbalances me in the future.
What you’re actually doing here is comparing, not praising. You are attempting to prop people up by kicking others down. Real praise is telling someone “Your report was amazing,” or “The comedic timing of your speech was perfect,” not telling them that their report or their speech was better than another person’s. Moreover, by telling someone they are “better” or “the best,” you are placing an unconscious, implicit limit on your expectation for what they can achieve. If we’re striving only to be better than someone else, doesn’t that set our expectations for ourselves too low? It tells us that as soon as we are just a little bit better than another person, we can stop trying, even if it means stopping short of our potential.

The Day–Stout–Warren (DSW) algorithm is a method for efficiently balancing binary search trees — that is, decreasing their height to O(log n) nodes, where n is the total number of nodes. Unlike a self-balancing binary search tree, it does not do this incrementally during each operation, but periodically, so that its cost can be amortized over many operations. The algorithm was designed by Quentin F. Stout and Bette Warren in a 1986 CACM paper,[1] based on work done by Colin Day in 1976.[2]

The algorithm requires linear (O(n)) time and is in-place. The original algorithm by Day generates as compact a tree as possible: all levels of the tree are completely full except possibly the bottom-most. It operates in two phases. First, the tree is turned into a linked list by means of an in-order traversal, reusing the pointers in the (threaded) tree's nodes. A series of left-rotations forms the second phase.[3] The Stout–Warren modification generates a complete binary tree, namely one in which the bottom-most level is filled strictly from left to right. This is a useful transformation to perform if it is known that no more inserts will be done. It does not require the tree to be threaded, nor does it require more than constant space to operate.[1] Like the original algorithm, Day–Stout–Warren operates in two phases, the first entirely new, the second a modification of Day's rotation phase.[1][3]

A 2002 article by Timothy J. Rolfe brought attention back to the DSW algorithm;[3] the naming is from the section title "6.7.1: The DSW Algorithm" in Adam Drozdek's textbook.[4] Rolfe cites two main advantages: "in circumstances in which one generates an entire binary search tree at the beginning of processing, followed by item look-up access for the rest of processing" and "pedagogically within a course on data structures where one progresses from the binary search tree into self-adjusting trees, since it gives a first exposure to doing rotations within a binary search tree."
Some people treat praise like a limited commodity. They believe that the key to advancement and success must be to absorb and rack up as much recognition and admiration as possible. This is the philosophy we learn in school, then hone to brutal efficiency in the working world.

Yet what these people fail to recognize is that praise is actually a renewable resource. Praise creates what I call a virtuous cycle — the more you give, the more you enhance your own supply. When done right, praise primes the brain for higher performance, which means that the more we praise, the more success we create. And the more successes there are, the more there is to praise. The research I’ve been doing over the past five years shows that the more you can authentically shine praise on everyone in your ecosystem, the more your potential, individually and collectively, rises.

god mahoyome threads are the worst. it's just patrician faggots trying to hide their insecurity by imposing that their show is the most godly show this season. don't you realise that slow threads do not imply it being a bad show? it simply means there's nothing to discuss about. everyone has read the manga already so everything is known. the show is slow so there's not much to shitpost about. the show is also good so there's not much to complain about. now contrast this to hnk threads. it is an adaptation of a niche manga, so barely anyone knew what is going to happen. it has a ton of shitposting materials (cgshit, su clone, waifufagging...). it is also dominating pixiv so fanarts dumping is common. all of this results in faster threads. basically slower threads do not mean the show is bad or nobody is watching it (compare the ip count with other threads), so stop being so insecure about it.
